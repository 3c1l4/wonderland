<h2> memories and consciousness, interpretations</h2>
<h4> 25/01/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

All interpretations are necessarily valid, as things do not exist objectively apart from perception. Perception needs interpretation and interpretation needs perception


Consciousness is no more than a series of interpretations 


what "ties" a consciousness across time other than the memories which we attribute tangible qualities? Is the continuity of these memories an interpretive illusion? Or is our "frame rate" really infinitesimal in length? 

We hold the belief that experience precedes memories - which are stored in a "consciousness" that exists tangibly across time. 

But in reality, the "me" that existed an instance ago is no more my consciousness in this instance than my consciousness is another in a different reincarnation. Memories are a mere evolutionarily modulated gateway across the fourth dimension.
