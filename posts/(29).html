	To Whom it may concern,

My body / brain is really smart. It’s really good at tricking me into doing things I don’t want to do. Like the midnight snacking: there is an array of snacks to choose from and as time has gone on my concoctions have gotten more complex— more randomly assorted. At first I’d grab a little half full of this or that, which developed into filling a small bowl with equal parts this and that and escalated to a dance: between the fridge and pantry Into one jar and then to another, then back again for seconds thirds fourths and so on — in incrementally smaller and smaller fractions that actually likely added up to greater sums. It was my body’s way of tricking me into thinking the habit changed: perhaps got better by being broken into smaller components; but in reality the habit didn’t change at all, in my head it was the same behaviour just manifesting 

I don’t want to snack at night, but my body is one lazy motherfucker: it’s much harder to break a cycle cold turkey than to break it into smaller pieces until it’s been sufficiently diluted: weaken the cycle by making smaller cycles of it until those are small enough to be negligible.
