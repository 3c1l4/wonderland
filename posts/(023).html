	To Whom it may concern,


It's been a week... Oh boy. 

I see the patterns all around me and they are all the fucking same thing. The stocks are the goddamn same, its like a huge network, like the human body. And all these systems are working in a beautiful synchrony with each other: all interactions bijective to the bodily system.

Of course thats how all things that work must work. All successful patterns necessarily converge to that of the prime numbers. 

It's just a matter of finding where upon the convergence the pattern is. 


How can I use this to my advantage now is my question? How can I map this motherfucker out properly?

I have so many theories and rules and all of it is one to one with the most beautiful of all: prime numbers. 

Ughhhhhh this stupid thing is just everywhere and everywhere all the same it is equally as complex to decode. The is endlessly frustrating:

They are all just different languages to talk about the same goddamn fucking pattern
