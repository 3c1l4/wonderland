	To Whom it may concern,

Good morning. Today just started and it sucks I am so tired. I felt so energetic and fantastic previous few days and now I am paying for it. Recovery!!!

Anyways going to do my leg exercises for recovery, finish my breakfast, type up a bit of my story then head to the gym to kill myself on the elliptical a little bit. Then I'll return.


Bonjour, it is now 3 pm and I am back. Went to gym, did not kill myself actually, instead just indulged in a relatively easy day, and came home and ate and now I am writing once more. I am not feeling super motivated to voice how I feel today, not as clear headed as I was this past week or so which is quite an interesting observation. God I need to take a shit so bad, I've already diarrhea-ed like 3 times today (see science notes for further elaborations sorry). Im going to go fo that and then come back and see if I am then motivated to share all the stupid (genius of course) thoughts Ive been having.
