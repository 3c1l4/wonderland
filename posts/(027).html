<h2> correlation, causation, variables suck! </h2>

	To Whom it may concern,

It’s very much possible to find, both intentionally and unintentionally, a correlation between a variable and some desired (or undesirable) effect in a multi variable ecosystem. 


For example, overtime, my resting heart rate may be negatively associated with my fitness — that is, the more fit I am the lower my resting heart rate; this model makes sense because we may use cardiac strength as a measure of fitness and therefore an improvement in my cardiac fitness will make my heart, not only more efficient, but also my muscles and tissues more efficient at absorbing necessary nutrients (particularly oxygen) from my blood — and thus my resting heart rate ( that is the minimum heart rate necessary to keep me alive and thriving), is lower. 


Your body is not consciously deciding these things — they are merely cascades of chemical reactions that we interpret and allocate meaning to. Broadly, a sensation. Such as Hunger is the body deciding it needs food - more specifically, the physical discomfort associated with a sensation we tacitly deem to be “hunger” is the body deciding that it needs something that it needs something (specifically food) that it has learned to associate with that deprivation signal cascade. 

These things can be learned and unlearned - it requires a conscious effort to understand how to subconsciously manipulate your body. 

You are the interpreter between the language of chemistry that is naturally embedded within you and the environment from which you nourish yourself. Your sensations, your brain, is the epicentre - the only point of contact that may bring into harmony the outside and inside and create synchrony.
