		To Whom it may concern,

I didn't get a chance to finish my entry from last night, shame. I did have many thoughts I wanted to reflect on so maybe ill just allude to them below. 


- ORGASMS?? Vagina is one crazy thing.
- running on uneven surface is king, never let your body fall into a comfortable habitual pattern of being, this just reinforces bad habits
- people are stupidly opinionated, and most of it comes from a logically consistent place in their minds. I don't blame them, but this makes it difficult for people to understand me because I always understand them and so from their perspective this only reinforces their own biases. 

Okay I left now Im back, its about 10 pm and I'm kind of sleeeeppyyy. There are so many thoughts I have been having and want to write about but I just wanna real and sleep.
