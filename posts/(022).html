<h2> generation by means of illusory ownership  </h2>
<h4> 14/01/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

Society is plagued by a disease of our purposelessness and individuals intoxicated by a boundless pursuit of individual power. 

- Growth is relative and thus cannot occur in a closed system
- A system can only expand if it generates
- We cannot generate through ownership - this is illusory, we are just trading "owners" not really creating anything, it's bullshit and the government shouldn't make "profit" off it. 
- We can only generate with services and innovation. 
- Optimization and efficiency is the only way to spur changre 
-We compromise our ability to grow with useless shit 
- This useless shit is a consequence of a selfish desire to own things

Growth is blunted, bounded by the breadth of the beat, when behaviour is allowed to find comfort in the predictability of pattern. Innovation is income.
