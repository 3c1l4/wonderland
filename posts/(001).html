<h2> new obsessions </h2>
<h4> 24/12/24 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

Perhaps this is the culmination of my new obsession. An (un)necessary stepping stone in my journey, or a pebble in the pond. In either case, the ripples are inevitable and I've begun begun a chain reaction of whose consequences we are now to observe–both as the creator and subject (or maybe victim is more apt?). Gosh what a strange entanglement I have created for myself.

I am doing this primarily out of boredom I suppose. For what else is there to ponder other than thoughts about how one ponders, what a silly little loop. I want nothing more than to deeply understand this world I find myself in and am compelled to create a tangible account of it. I do not know why (well I suppose I do, but I cannot explain it, but, supposing you are me, then you know as well as I do, and so I need not articulate justification). Here I am. Writing about... writing. 

Today was a bit of a tumultuous day in the most boring way possible. I had a boring, slow morning, and a boring slow workout, and felt emotionally plagued by boring problems.
