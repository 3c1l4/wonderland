	To Whom it may concern,

Um okay I have my last entry open and I did not fulfill my promise to update after having breakfast. What happened? I don't really remember to be honest. 

Got busy I suppose.


HAHA 23:54 right now (I wrote that all at like 7 am) I got HELLA BUSY but I made 2k today and wrote some smut so it's a win kind of day.
