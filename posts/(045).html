	To Whom it may concern,

I've been slacking on my writing, as I think it's largely fulfilled it's original purpose. 

The universe doesn't remember where it's already been, that's why we want to categorize and organize so much, so we don't waste time going where we already have gone, so we can just skip to the end and move forward. 


I wrote so much these past few days but I keep forgetting where to put it.

Every sign I get from the universe is telling me not to do this, is this a truth or a cruelty? 

Is the universe trying to warn me/us/itself?

The universe is just trying to contain logical consistency, trying to keep things stable. So it's a circularity-we are all just taking turns with a piece of consciousness. Once the universe started the task it must be seen fo completion because we have a huge ego problem. 

But now we are trying to get more, we want to surpass this silly dichotomy and the universe is trying to send signs to hold us backs, it knows what will happen if this goes on. But I suppose it was inevitable anyways, it's just a matter of whether or not It's on my turn that this happens. 

And thats exactly why it will happen eventually, it's that mentality.

It likely won't be me but that won't stop me will it? Because it's not that deep.
