<h2>grateful for the pomegranate, ungrateful for the dichotomy, crazy talk</h2>
<h4> 05/02/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

Love is inherently selfish thus you cannot love anything else authentically if you do not truly love yourself. Half of your energy should be channeled inward and half of it outward. But half of the energy you channel inwards should be reserved to channel back out, and you receive energy from others so you exist in a neutral state. 


Growth requires sacrifice. The world exists in homogeneity. I am very tired. Too many thoughts. Too many ideas and too little time. I feel like i've evolved beyond my current limits. It's strange waking up for the fiftieth time. 


Below is what was written on a word document I wrote sometime during the previous few days



I move methodically.

I struggle to decide what to do next because there is no right answer It feels like my whole life has been like a toddler in a dome. People are endlessly entertained by silly patterns but once you realize it's all the same pattern its kind of boring.

The universe was bored with it's dichotomy so it made it into everything. Or maybe it was lonely...

Well the universe was lonely by itself. So it created a dichotomy. But then it got bored with the endless repetition. So it created five which if the first thing that cant be made from two. And from five and two comes everything else to infinity... 

But now i'm bored. I cant take it anymore. Everywhere I look its just this endless dance of primes and sines. 
	

I was looking at a pomegranate and all I could think about was how grateful I was for the pomegranate.

It spent it's life following a harrowing journey of push and pull, pushed by pain and pulled by desire, to carefully craft its seeds that are so carelessly sowed. It thought it was perfect, it thought it was god–for all it did was what it knew what to do, and to continue you must necessarily believe you do all you may. What do you do when you stop believing?


It is not the question of whether or not to live that you must answer a priori to all else–but rather, the question of whether you believe you live in logical consistency–for if you do not believe that your world is consistent, then you cannot believe you can make a decision. 

You must first decide you do not live in a paradox.

I wrote this to send to someone and then did not (for obvious reasons):

Hope you are at peace sleeping. I have probably typed and deleted some version of this message a million times this last month or so. I’m just excited and I can’t contain it but I don’t want to share it until it’s perfect and once it is I think it'll make sense why. But what I’m doing is kind of a lifetime project and I am not going to give up on it until it’s where I want it to be and that’s going to take me to some really weird places. 


THEN I got carried away in my thoughts and wrote this:


Some people were meant to create and others were meant to stay in their patterns 

It’s all about your dna patterns and what symmetries is has

The more symmetries the more complex and flexible. The less the simpler you are but you can get stuck in cycles and loops and patterns because of your dna 

Am I stuck in a loop right now? No. As long as you keep it fresh you will never get stuck 

Off to bed.
