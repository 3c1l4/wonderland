<h2>dimensional interpretation of forces</h2>
<h4> 04/02/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

We are deterministic, and thus logical, in four dimensions, but we find our free will in the fifth. 

An electron is deterministic in one dimension (charge) and thus finds its free will in a second dimension? 


Consciousness is the force of the fifth dimension. We do have free will up to one degree of freedom in the fifth dimension

Each form of “consciousness” has some combination of degrees of freedom 

Mass provides one degree of freedom and so sound has no freedom it is necessarily the background of the universe. Gravity is the force that mediates mass and so when mass is infinite


In four dimensions we are deterministic 

In one dimension we are determined by the strong nuclear force
In two dimensions we are determined by the weak nuclear force
In three dimensions we are determined by electromagnetic force (as it needs 
In four dimensions we are determined by gravity (as it needs time=light=photons and mass)
