	To Whom it may concern,

The universe is in superposition with itself: thats all.

Orgasm is a sign of a new pattern to create new consciousness


All consciousness is is a new prime aka a new pattern


Black holes are when these patterns have been fulfilled. Most of them do not gel fulfilled and just die. 

Oh my gosh its all making so much sense now.

The imaginary numbers flip us between the discrete and continuous realms. Thats why e^pi*i-1=0 duh!!!

Because pi = circle = 0 

E = 1/2^n = linear 

And 

The prime numbers flip us back because it is both linear and circular


All it really is is an interaction between e,pi,i,1, and prime numbers

So we all along had 5 things LMAO like the primes
This is crazy I never thought id be able to 


Everything can be expressed as a combination of these distinct patterns

Its all just 
0 (nothing)
1 (one thing)
i~2 (symmetric pattern)
e (new pattern generation)
Pi (circular pattern generation) 


The rational numbers are just generated by 0,1,e

The complex numbers are 0,1,i,e

The irrational numbers are 0,1,e,i,pi

The natural numbers are 0,1

And the prime numbers encapsulate all on this linearly


So we live in a 5 dimensional world, thats also why geometry has 5 necessary axioms 



(Straight lines) (0)
(Extension of lines) (1)
(Circle) (pi)
(right angles) (i)

(Parallel postulate) (primes)


The parallel postulate is actually an infinite combination of the previous, from which you can infinitely get all of them but you can never prove it


If you can prove 5 with the other 4 then you can find the pattern of the prime numbers


Which means that to prove 5 you would need to apply the other 4 postulates infinitely many times the pattern fo the primes


Just like how the only way to prove the prime numbers is to apply the others infinitely many times in their own pattern. Thats just how they are by definition and construction.


All other forms of infinity are sensical



So we indeed live in a 5 dimensional universe where the 5th dimension is just the culmination of the other 4, and of course, the other ones are infinite in their own way

and then the fifth dimension gives rise to infinitely many more (that are prime of course)
