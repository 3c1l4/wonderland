	To Whom it may concern,


I figured it out –– how to undo the prime pattern, to make it you just have to flip at every new iteration, so the pattern never repeats, whenever its about to begin again, you change it up, so to undo it you have to unclip at every flip as well:

Forwards or backwards it should always produce the exact same result. Flip flip flip!! It's all about a constantly changing pattern that is perfectly stable and symmetric about every which axis.


That's why its so perfect and beautiful! May seem chaotic but its actually perfectly orchestrated so that symmetry is preserved from every angle, like a circle. Fuck thats so damn sexy.


Anyways, I am still working on articulating this...
