<h2> christmas crap </h2>
<h4> 25/12/24 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

Last night was the Christmas dinner we did at my dad's place, so naturally I got a bit carried away and didn't manage to finish my thoughts. It is now 9:26 AM and I am typing on my computer while my dad doom scrolls on his WhatsApp or wherever it is he gets those obnoxious videos from, and my brother is slowly getting up, after being pestered by my dad to get his day started. 

I am honestly a bit frustrated with my dad's approach to parenting, and overall life. I don't know how to voice this with him because he's a cranky man now and unwilling to change. Even the calmest demeanour gets me a rude impatient response from him. For example, he was getting impatient with Arthur to get up and have breakfast and I said to let him rest that there was no rush... (it's literally the least rushed day of the year, is it not?), and he got angry with me and said "da Uma folga", to which I responded, about what and he just grumbled in his grumpy old way ignored me. 

Does typing this even help me process what happened or come up with better solutions? Possibly, possibly not, but it is a way to stay accountable for my reaction and reflect on how I can manage my own behaviour better so that I don't feel burdened by these feelings of frustration. Meditations... perhaps? I guess that is the point of this journal for the most part anyways. It's funny, even when I try to talk about the most menial boring real-life shit I end up on some silly philosophical ramblings. 

Anyways, I have no idea what I am doing today, its now 9:33 AM, I am typing on my computer, sitting across the table from my dad who's drinking erva mate and still doom scrolling, and my brother who's tiredly eating some pancakes, oranges, and sausages with a cup of nasty ass sugar juice. What a grinch I am, I hate Christmas. Stupid holiday for stupid people. Not that there's anything wrong with being stupid, but don't subject me to this dogshit and try to justify it by saying it's a festivity, selfish assholes!


Oh and don't even get me started on how wasteful this dumb holiday is. All those stupid plastic stocking stuffers, decorations, and ugly shitty clothes that'll just end up in the landfill. And then people buy into this garbage and justify their lack of accountability by saying it's the corporations' faults. Anyways, I did say don't get me started on it, then I started myself up anyway. Silly me, let's think of something more positive.

Went for a walk with my mom and brother outside and he didn't even complain, in fact he was grateful he was hanging out with us. What a pleasure, what can I do to keep him happy?Being a teenager sucks, I just hope he doesn't have it too bad, though he needs to have a little bit of rain to get to the rainbow. Oh well. That's life I guess.


Overall, today was okay. That is the world's biggest understatement, but recently I've felt like everyday is the most revolutionary day ever. What a way to live huh. I don't know if this is a sign that I'm doing things right or a sign that I'm way off path. I will take it as a positive sign for now and continue to be the confident boss ass bitch I am anyways.
