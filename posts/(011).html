	To Whom it may Concern,

Oops the past few entires have been all over the place, I guess its a pretty accurate reflection of my mental state. 

I have now wasted half of my morning writing this stupid story that I will probably end up not even sharing with him. It doesn't feel like it's for him anymore, I've bled too much of myself into it and now it's unintelligible and shit.

Maybe I need a bit of a brain break to be honest. 

I've been doing far too much thinking and reflecting this past week and now find myself a bit drained. Or maybe I just need some fucking breakfast. Will update after I do that LOL
