<h2> masturbation mentale </h2>

	To Whom it may concern,

I swear I wrote an entry yesterday but now I can't find it on my computer.


Many,,,,, philosophical musings to confess. Though it has felt increasingly difficult to find the right words to communicate the way I intend. I suppose I must settle for incomplete lacklustre incoherencies that no one will really understand. Thats okay, I need to be okay with that.

Yesterday was interesting. Morning gym (classic) first biggish run in quite some time. Also I'm so proud of my mom with her running recently she's actually just... popping off, she's incredible and has no idea it's so sad. Then I hung out with Michael from 2-8 ish... was interesting! We had a good time. I do recall writing about this last night when I got home at around 9:30 because I can distinctly remember typing out "Michael" lol! I felt a twinge of deja-vu doing that just now.

Anyways – he's right about what he said about me. At least I think. Am I right to engage in these feelings? Am I being authentic to myself or am I trying to create a character whose skin I am comfortable wearing; are these movements just a complex dance to justify what I am doing. What even is it that I am doing...
All these things.... Falling apart. 

I feel like I no longer live and exist where it is that I (must be as there is no other alternative) be living and existing. This place feels more and more foreign by the minute and I don't think I'm doing myself many favours by questioning it to a stupid fault. 

La masturbation mentale, tres belle!
