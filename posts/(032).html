<h2> athletics, patterns, the human body, more patterns</h2>

	To Whom it may concern,

Some thoughts I had while swimming and then spoke to my phone while walking in the -30 ass weather on 0.25g of mushrooms. None of this is true or grammatically correct. 


OK, I think it’s all starting to make complete sense. Well not starting because the ball has been rolling for a while now, but everything is making complete sense and wow, I am astonished.

So everything is a pattern and at the beginning it started with the most basic pattern, one which we call one you what we do choose to call this does not really matter at all it’s arbitrary, but we must choose someplace to begin.

So the pattern which would just go on and on and on 11111… And so on forever this pattern, most necessarily get interrupted by itself because if all we had was one and now we have a pattern of ones now there exists not just the ones in this pattern of ones, but the relationship between them, and that is something which we call two, so just by virtue of existing this pattern interferes with itself and creates new pattern

And this pattern, which we will arbitrarily call to interferes with a one to create three and so on and so on and this cascades forever almost instantly.

And so everything is just some finite instance of these patterns together and these patterns together, create new patterns and new numbers in the world of our interpretation that is so we get from this all of the patterns that are repeated and all of the patterns that are distinct.

So for example 12357 and so on all distinct patterns because they cannot be represented or rather collapse into smaller patterns

Whereas all the composite numbers can necessarily be represented by repetitions of previous patterns and so they are not necessarily newer distinct.

And so everything that exists in this universe can be mapped onto some prime number or some composite number.

So we are all just very, very, very large large numbers very complex, complicated patterns, though finite almost infinitely complex Floating around and interacting with each other in ways that are not necessarily predictable they just are.

Anything that is allegedly predictable is just modelled to a very accurate degree by some pattern but in reality that is not what is going on specifically.

It is just much more probable that we find ourselves in a composite number than a prime number, therefore things tend to make sense much of the time and at any point when something doesn’t make sense according to the patterns in a very objective sense, that means we have created a prime number, and these are represented by in our universe by black holes.

Because they have reached some sort of new infinite complexity. It’s the only new distinct thing that exists and everything that interact with a collapses into the black hole and enters a new universe Where it all repeats again, but under the axiom of that prime number.

So everything we are and everything we do are just these patterns and it’s so simple and obvious, and though our brains are very complex, it is very difficult to articulate intelligently very complicated pattern so although we understand very simple things like 12357 and so forth, we are very limited by this All the patterns that exist around us, our orders and orders and orders of magnitude much more complex than this.

So we have two competing models of the universe one which works top down where we take our observations and try to work from that down to the most basic fundamental Patterns and the other one where we bottom up, where we work rather than the things we may observe and tangibly interact with the theoretical things that we must logically conjure.

And at some point these two will meet in the middle to marry and create a cohesive model of where we exist to some degree.

So physics and mathematics are the foundation that to build bottom up and you know, psychology, sociology, biology down to chemistry and what not our the models we’ve created that work from the top down.

And they meet somewhere in the middle to provide us with information about how things possibly are.

Everything is a pattern and while I was swimming yesterday, I had the epiphany where even athletics it’s all just about synchronizing the different patterns within us so you know in biology we have these hormonal Cascades that can be modelled by different polynomial functions because in reality that’s all these things are different Patterns that interact with our pattern and drive our pattern.

And so all of athletics even the very intricate parts of it like the metabolism and the nutrition and everything and the recovery is a matter of synchronizing these patterns so that there is no friction in between the systems.

More tangently it’s much easier to think about synchronizing our heart rate with our cadence and synchronizing that again with a breathing so that all of these patterns occur at the same beats to a larger degree, and thus reduce the chance that we lose any energy to interference and friction.

When I was on the elliptical today, I managed to push to a pace of about 230 minutes per kilometre for a ridiculously long time while only keeping my heart rate heart rate at a certain level and keeping the cadence at a match level and keeping my breathing all the same synchronized and I was just thinking about all the other different systems in my body that at this moment, we’re working in synchrony with this to reduce the Interference between all these different wavelength.

So for example, the frequency of oestrogen release or insulin release or the glucose uptake of the cells and the electrical signals that zap through this, and that and all of these things in cohesion that of course we’re not perfectly synchronized because at some point this dance has to end, but they reached a larger synchrony than I am Normally accustomed to because I put so much mental energy into trying to achieve that result.

And it worked I pushed two fucking 30 per kilometre for like several minutes probably not several minutes maybe like a minute and a half but still that’s like half a kilometre just by focussing this mental energy on that and then later when I kind of got out of this trans state it was like I lost the power and I was even struggling to push like five minutes per kilometre on the thing cause I had exited the state this natural flow state.

So athletics is just a matter of practising these patterns and flow states and though Running seems to be the most simple one it’s just left right left right like how can you fuck that up but no, there is a way to get better at doing the whole left right thing it’s the most simple pattern we can do but it is the most complicated to perfect because there’s only one way to get it right whereas other patterns like 123 well there’s several ways to perfect that you could do 3 to 1 you could do 132 and so on and even more complicated patterns represented by prime numbers, orders of magnitude larger, have many more ways of accurately being represented and so though There is no objective way to get it right, there are many different ways to get it, right

So if consciousness is mapped onto the universe manifested as the large prime numbers i.e. each consciousness is uniquely represented as a prime number whereas inert or abiotic matter is represented by composite numbers then it would make sense that there is only one way for each consciousness to be-to order itself and manifest because, of course, groups of prime quantities have unique interpretations. What I'm trying to get at is that there is only one way to be me. There is only one way to perfect my life and that will be whatever I do. I am not a replica and I should not fear being stolen or copied. I am an impossible piece of the universe to replicate because I require observation of myself in order to be me, that is the last piece to my puzzle that completes the mosaic of my life.
