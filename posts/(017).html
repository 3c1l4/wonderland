	To Whom it may Concern,

WOOhoooo0 okay I managed to go to bed at like 6:30 yesterday and get up today at 5 ish. I obviously didn't sleep the whole time through (woke up several times) BUT I got up well rested with at least 9 hours of sleep. So today has been a nice productive day so far. 

It is now 9:30 pm. Just got home like 30 minutes ago after spending the day with Michael. What an interesting time I am having with him. I don't even know how to articulate it. I wish I could record our conversations to translate it to written so I could relive it form an un-tranced perspective.

It's so easy to engage in those kinds of conversations in the heat of the moment but in hindsight I don't know how authentic it is. I am kind of tired I think I will go to bed now and sleep on it.
