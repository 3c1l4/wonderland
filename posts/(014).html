	To Whom it may Concern,

Good morning! 

Haha that good morning was hours ago. I am so busy today but I do need to buckle down and write I feel like I'm going to explode So tonight when I have time I will dedicate a bit of time for that.


Okay, now it is almost 10 pm and I got home about an hour ago, I was out with Rick the 66 year old sugar daddy guy. We played squash then cuddled a bit and had some dinner. I think he's jealous of Michael to be honest because he's feeling a bit insecure about the money comparison, how silly for a 66 year old man to act this way, no?

Anyways, I think I haven't actually spoken about any of the sugar daddy business on this journal yet, but it's okay, you know exactly what it is I'm talking about. I have made like 5k so far this past week or so, how insane. But still all I can think about is Armando. I like this lifestyle, the freedom it gives me, but I also like him. I think I need youth in my life, but why must it be one or the other? I want the best of both worlds, but I can't have it.

Ontop of that, there are so many other things I also want, and though I have the rest of my life to get them, I know that my youth is limited. I need to ration it with respect otherwise it will do me dirty. And here I am wasting my life away exercising, selling my body, and trying to convince myself that I am preserving my dignity, and doing my future self a favour. 

Fuck knows what the right thing would be to do. There can always be a case made for every choice and option because there will always be an interpretation of the present that will create the future that you want it to (or perhaps don't, its just semantics, I mean the future that you are trying to justify). Contingencies are all just facts (or vice verse, whatever...)

Wow I typed that all so fucking fast my wrists started to hurt a bit. Back to writing for Armando now. Writing a lil bit of a smutty story for his birthday but I'm being obnoxiously perfectionistic about it and its taking fucking forever to write even like one paragraph. What if he hates it lol. I'm feeling like such a fucking idiot.
