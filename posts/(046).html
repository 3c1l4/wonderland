	To Whom it may concern,

If I keep seeing this through I risk losing the stability of dichotomy, to continue deeper I need to reinforce this axiom, at every iteration it fades a little bit more.

I need to be equally grounded in this pursual in order to make anything productive of it. 

All my postulates make me sound like a total crackpot but im just following binary logic to see where it takes me-to find it's limits.


Everything we model and structure necessarily has to follow logically from our system of logic. And so we may instead study how our logical system works in order to understand all else that comes from it. 

There is no room for contradiction in our dimension and it can always be "explained away" with another variable that has been unaccounted for. This is the basis of our system. 


Where do we go from here?
Keep talking.
