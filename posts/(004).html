<h2> love letter </h2>
<h4> 27/12/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may Concern,


So yeah, last night got ready for the date, couldn't help but check the message. Pleasantly surprised with his reaction but I really don't feel the same vibes coming from him that I give and that I feel when we're together in person so I think I'll just try to move on from this because I don't want to hurt him or myself. By the way the context is Armando and the "love" letter I wrote him. Though he was typing for quite some time and then didn't send another message, and then later sent another message checking up on me. Weird fella, can't entirely read him but I think he's created some walls in his mind because of his horrible past relationship. Not that this is really a relationship in the common sense of the word–but he certainly struggles to shake his definitions a bit too. Rigid. 

Anyways, that's all well and good as far as things go. I had a really particular thought this morning while making coffee and made a mental note to write it down that I wanted to process it more but now I've completely forgotten what the fuck it was. What a fucking idiot. I guess it wasn't that important lol, but then again none of this garbage word vomit is.
