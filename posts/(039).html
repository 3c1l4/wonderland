Prime number model of growth

It’s essentially like two steps forward one step backwards except you don’t actually move out of place you remain symmetric but still manage to move forward.

Within the prime numbers fits the prime number pattern so when you move forward, you preserve symmetry by moving backwards, just enough so that when taken to infinity you end up in the same place 


It’s like an oscillation that actually moves forward and increases, but approaches zero 


What do prime numbers look like on the complex plane?


Prime number model of growth is a learning model and a growth model. It is the only way to move forward without fucking things up.

Every possible combination of sums of the prime numbers will get us to zero when you some a prime number of prime numbers.

For example , 1+2-3

+5-7+11 

Any combination of pluses and minuses a.k.a. zeros and ones in between the prime numbers will always get us to zero at some point.

So if we can map out the zeros and ones and the combinations which get us to zero, this gives us a binary interpretation of the patterns that drive the prime numbers.

Similarly we can combine these numbers in groups of three or groups of five etc. etc. for all the prime numbers to get mappings in higher power roots of these prime numbers.

But it remains that regardless of which base you choose as long as it is prime, we will obtain a sum of zero

Or a product or an exponentiation, etc.


The number of primes that you need in order to balance it back into zero to get to homeostasis depends on the symmetry of the object so objects with binary symmetry you do it on a one zero one zero pattern whereas if you have object with greater symmetry, such as 357 or whatever you count by three or whatever respective symmetry degree it is.
But it will always be able to sum to zero now the question is how many primes will it take for it to go back into homeostasis?

I suspect it is related to powers of two or powers of a base of the prime symmetry we are working with.
