<h2> stability, gravity, primes, written crazily </h2>
<h4> 05/01/25  </h2>

		To Whom it may concern,

This is so obvious now


Electron orbitals - they are unstable alone, pattern 2 




If black holes are these prime numbers then what does this say about gravity??

Gravity is necessarily time, it is necessary for time to go on 


Technically it is the exact opposite force to time, entirely antithetical, so where time is 0 gravity is infinite


Time goes outwards and gravity goes inwards. 



And *particles* are just discrete patterns that started on this fabric, we need time to keep the ball rolling and we need gravity to cause interactions between things

So gravity is the 0 time is the 1, and then electron is the 2 and so on… 


from that everything else inevitably follows, that's why light and gravity are antithetical and at a black hole there is no time and only gravity

once we create all the patterns (aka infinity) we have infinite time and it collapses into gravity and starts all over again

How on earth do I explain this to normal people without sounding like a fucking nut job idiot? It just makes so much goddamn sense in my silly little math brain. 

Why do I even want to explain this so badly?

Why not. Why not. Just remember sometimes there is no explanation you have fallen so deep into this loop. You need to get out of it for a bit so that you can reinforce the pattern and not be lost in this stupid sea of masterless mind stuff. 


If you take gravity to the limit (infinite) it is an instantaneous interaction represented by a continuous process/force. But at the limit of gravity is a new thing. Discrete entities do not exist, only one thing.


Everything is just one big long infinitely dimensional thing edging itself infinitely many times over. 

we just call certain patterns in this fabric by different things. Quantum mechanics makes perfect sense because particles don’t actually "exist".

Everything must necessarily be interacting with both gravity and time with infinite frequency.

An observer is a new pattern, things can only interact when there are new patterns present, 

Otherwise they just interfere and superimpose

But when it is PRIME, when it is a NEW DISTINCT peak/pattern, it momentarily must become discrete in order to perpetuate. 


Gravity forces this interaction 



They are all just wavelengths interfering with each other and causing either a synchrony that superposes the waves, or a friction that collapses it.


So if observation causes a collapse of the wave function this just means that it perfectly cancels it out. 

Which means that it is the last necessary piece of the prime puzzle.
