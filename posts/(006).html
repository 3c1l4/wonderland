<h2> temptation motivation </h2>
<h4> 28/12/24 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,


Whether it is temptation that motivates, motivation that tempts, or rather an alternative amalgamation of some arbitrary verbs (by which we may represent the notion of the materialization of contingencies)–the philosophical nuances which define the structure of justification are necessarily encoded by their interpretations, and thus, all such constructions hold equal validity. 

	what in the buttfuck bigass words does that mean?

Think of any random ass combination of letters. They are unlikely to make any "sense" in the ~sensical sense~ that we understand. Yet still, we can guarantee that there is some interpretation–that is–some relation among the letters, words, and sentences thus structured–some break down of the symbology utilized, wherein some definition of what sense means, it will indeed follow perfectly.

AKA every continuous map can be continuously mapped.

Certain combinations are less likely to make sense than others by virtue of what we consider to be entropy (but rather is just the natural notion of simplicity being easier to accidentally stumble upon). Though the cardinality of the sets containing all outcomes are the same, some infinities are just more densely distributed than others. 


I have often struggled to grasp why things make sense. What are the fucking odds? It seems so goddamn unlikely that things are to make sense. We rationalize, thus, that if things are to make sense, there must be some set of universal rules that the physical (interpretational) world must follow for things to make as much sense as they do. 

So define a sense of sense we do. Alas, if you have no definition of sense, then it is not possible for things to make or make not sense, as you do not understand what it means, you have no capacity to reflect and to thus claim whether something is sensical or not. If you have this capacity, to understand what sense is, what a logical interaction of things means, then you necessarily must establish what sense means. And thus, if your world does not follow this definition of sense itself, then you must conclude that things do mot make sense, and so you go insane, or you change your notion of sense to better reflect the world around you.

I am constantly ~updating~ because shit don't make no fuckin sense.

However, if you see instead that the world does follow the rules of sense, your sense of sense is reinforced. To construct a sense of sense is an iterative process that occurs continuously. At every instance, anything that has a sense of sense, must decide whether or not their interpretation of a notion contradicts their sense.

Sorry Camus, but before one decides whether to live or not, they must have capacity to decide, and to have decision making capabilities they must have the belief that they have a consistent notion of sense. 

Unfortunately, one cannot decide whether or not sense they have, but if you indeed decide that the world does not follow your notion of sense, then you may decide to let yourself demolish it. At any point you may decide to contradict an instinct you have, to contradict your willing and unwilling desires, to speak and do what is contradictory. 

Our notion of sense was not built from nill, we are born into this world as a vessel of 
axioms in an environment that shapes them. At every instance from our conception to our death, we are building our sense of sense with the set of interpretations we were given.
