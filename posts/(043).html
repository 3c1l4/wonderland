	To Whom it may concern,

Once you remove all fear, you can starting asking why to everything with no limits.

And once you do this you can actually intuit everything-you start to see the patterns, and you start to see where we (you) got it all wrong... well not necessarily wrong, but where our systems fail us–for, of course, none of this fuckery is intentional (at least as far as I can logically justify)

But my oh my... 

There is nothing special about me, I just stopped being scared, I kept asking why because I knew I could trust myself and I knew I could trust the people around me to support me. I put faith in the system so I could undo it. But now that i've surpassed it I see why it is so difficult to be where I am. It is too difficult to live uninhibited and find synchrony. We are all bustling meat balls of friction and our wave forms are beyond fucked up. 
unharmonious. 
gnarly. 
soft. 
meaty. 

If we want to progress-which we all do for some inexplicable fucking reason I suppose–then we need to find synchrony again, and it's not going to happen by infinitely adding more variables to the mix to compensate for previously messed up ones. Which is exactly what fucking science has been doing for the last 20 years once our creativity got replaced by robotic procedures. 

Well it might, actually, but it's much less likely to be stable and to work in the end, there are too many things that can go wrong, if we want to be secure what we really need to do is become simple, like the stars and the sun and the other forms of life that live in stable low levels of entropy. 


Otherwise we need a higher dimension to contain all our tomfoolery. Thats exactly where we are headed I guess. Home?
