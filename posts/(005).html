	To Whom it may Concern,

Okay last night was kind of fun. Finally once again entering the good part of my cycle. God why does this have to happen so often, it's actually insane to think about and experience, it's even more insane to think that men don't have this, they are completely different creatures to us. 

Anyways, went out dancing with Marina but not after having some deep philosophical talk at the bar first. Well, actually it was more like me leaking bitter philosophical nectar. It's very nice to have someone that understands on a deeper level, such a difficult thing to find and have, especially with these fucked up brain genes I got. But it was good. Cathartic conversation for me even though I hardly touched on all the craziness festering inside. But there is no rush and I suppose some things were not meant to be shared. 

But yeah, then after we went to National to dance. NO one fucking dances. I went off though, an absolute dancing machine. I love being me I am so grateful for the lack of inhibition I've (partially been blessed with but mostly) created for myself. I am so grateful for the people in my life who have helped me build this version of myself by giving me pieces of who they are. 

There is no fine boundary between us, it's quite neat really. That's just the romantic perspective, it's necessary but beauty is by no means real. But I will indulge in this rather optimistic view of existence, as otherwise, I'm stuck coping with controlled suffering and tragedy. Need a lil love too, it can't all be science, sadism, and nihilism.
