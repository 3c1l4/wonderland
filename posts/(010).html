	To Whom it may Concern,

Well good morning and happy new year. It appears as though I have adopted my current self as my own audience rather than a future contingency, as it is quite nonsensical to wish any other audience a happy new year. This choice was not purposeful at all, I just opened my computer and started typing. 

Or maybe, my audience is a ghostly entity, an imaginary friend of sorts to whom I desire to subject my absurd musings. (That was a really weird sentence but grammatically correct, I feel so pretentious writing sometimes...)

If you read my past few entries, you'll (who? I don't know clearly) will notice they are shitty and unfinished and I only briefly allude to a "many thoughts" I want to share (with whom?). Despite being an unemployed and rather avoidant procrastinating bum, I have been busy–mentally, physically, in any way that I can justify and blame my inability to buckle the fuck down and be productive I suppose. I have a few digital lists in progress with very vague bullet points of things I am not so sure whether or not I have already discussed. I will list them below and then maybe (or maybe not) touch on them in further detail: go with the flow!

- orgasms
- leg thing
- uneven surface longevity. Different step patterns
- *grocery list* (which includes toothpaste that we went specifically to the store to purchase yesterday and forgot, instead leaving the store with about $40 worth of cheese)
- *marina's reminder to do list*
- "we are all the universe trying to exist in every possible way, time travel is possible and exists infinitely in all of us" (I now remember, about which I had a dream of sorts, I was trying to explain this to my dad to my utter failure to articulate my sentiments in a manner comprehensible to anyone else)
- "had some soup got super cold"
- first three numbers prime, first 5 odd numbers prime, first 7 ???
- 0,1 everything else. Classes where order doesn't matter.
- "definitely have that forever steady energy today"
- "diarrhea poos. Not puddles. Kind of burn butthole"
- "my vagina smells intensely"


Well, now that thats done I can delete these god forsaken lists and hopefully use this space to passively reflect upon which I intended to actively reflect. 

I have now decided that I will not infact further elaborate on any of those topics for the sake of *your* entertainment (whoever you may be).

There are a few other things I want to reflect on and so I will use this platform to do that. Okay wait actually, I really want to get this story done so maybe I'll use this to give context to what I mean and intent to accomplish by that, and then plan a bit how to proceed because right now its just flowery word vomit. 

OKAY so I am trying to write a story for Armando's birthday because IDFK what to get him and I thought it would be cute to send him a short story about himself to his kindle. So far Im dabbling with the idea of a guy exploring in the arctic summer in pursuit of finding a place to build his home, far from everyone and everything, when he encounters a ....


I got carried away and started writing the story again. That was at like 11 am now It is 1 am the following day (whoops) goodbye!
