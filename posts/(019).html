<h2> evolutionary barter </h2>

	To Whom it may concern, 

As always evolution had it right. Nature created the perfect hierarchal system of barter and we went and fucked it up by adding an intermediary which is always subject to faltering to more miscommunication through transcription error. 

Materials should be free, free for consumption and thus free of ownership labels. The notion of possession should be reserved to what you posses over your body etc.

We must first begin with a motivation so I invite you to ask yourself what it is that you truly selfishly want in the most general sense of the sentiment,

In the language, not of nouns or ..... Well actually,

(tangent alert)

Consequent of subjectivity it solely concerns perspective whether one believes it is nouns, verbs, or adjectives that are primitive. To purport noun primitivity necessarily invites the acceptance of a contingency wherein verbs and adjectives must thus, in succession, establish themselves hierarchically—reflected in primary manifestations prioritized by such assortment. 

It is possible to form a coherent logically sound system from any such interpretation and thus none provides intrinsic objective superiority except when applied in context: poisoned by assumptions. 


We must separately analyze each such axiomatic interpretation and attempt to infer how biases of our nature interact.
