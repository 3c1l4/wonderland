<h2>orgasms and patterns</h2>

	To Whom it may concern,

The more patterns you get in you the more you can apply them to other parts

You need to be a jack of all trades to figure stuff out. No limits. 

What patterns am I missing?? 

The orgasm is just a new pattern (4 dimensional body pattern??)

Make choices randomly but react strategically. You’ll eventually stumble on the right path by virtue of prime evolution. It’s just how it works. 

Every interpretation is just a unique language that speaks the same pattern 

Music is made from melodies and harmonies synchronized by chords and notes and beats. Our bodies the way we move a series of muscle activations and systems in synchrony to create harmony. Patterns are the path of least resistance—so resist; be prime. 

The human body is an intricate and deeply complex dynamic system; it is unsimplifiable by paltry static models of simple hormonal cascades, vitamin stores, and tissue system interactions. We cannot reduce the human body to static models without sacrificing necessary context. Our current understanding of the body paints a myopic picture of the much more intricate and quantum reality. 

Rather, to truly understand it requires an unrelentingly dynamic—and by all means, quantum—picture we rather exist in superposition. Our solutions are different ways of summing prime numbers in ways that preserve prime symmetries.

For example recall that 7 is 151 but also 232 these two solutions are in superposition since they both use the symmetry of 3 
Or also 7 is 1111111 and 11311 and 12121 etc etc. 

These are different ways to arrive at 7 

Our bodies are pretty much the same. Just the culmination of much more complex and chaotic looking equations. The veracity in the partition is a matter of perspective. 

It even explains why I’m here talking about this. The pattern repeats itself to create more primes. Which is interpreted as this consciousness loop.
