<h2> loneliness </h2>
<h4> 23/01/25  </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

If one thinks it can be explained, then that is why they cannot understand.

It all makes so much sense and yet I cannot articulate it nor do I have the desire to any longer. All I want is for others to feel the freedom and beauty that understanding this ~thing~ provides–or, maybe, I just don't want to feel so fucking lonely with my thoughts. 

It's not that I don't want to isolate myself and not talk to others, it just feels frustrating not being understood. All I can compare it to is if a "normal" person wanted to have a meaningful interaction with a toddler-all they can really get away from it is: (1) to live vicariously through their innocence and jubilation; and (2) to learn something from them that they indirectly teach by coincidence. That's kind of how I feel with a lot of people around me, it's as though they are some silly little bugs and ants and creatures that sometimes by accident teach me something that I would have eventually stumbled upon by other means.

That is not a critique of them by any means – I don't think I'm better just because I am this way nor that they are worse in any shape (it's just a natter of perspective for one to believe that this sort of intelligence is superior but in reality it has no significance)–I am just venting my frustrations of loneliness.
