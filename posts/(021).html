	To Whom it may concern,

Stability requires unpredictability otherwise there is a weak point that can be taken advantage of in the pattern

 
Prime numbers are ultimate unpredictability so any stable system must necessarily model (rather, trend towards the model of) the prime number


The integrity of a system has to necessarily be repeatedly tested through novelty otherwise it will not learn the new patterns but it can only get a new pattern once it’s thoroughly exhausted and learned all the existing ones

Like prime numbers... duh


And then when it learns a new pattern all it can do is combine it in every single way with other existing patterns

Once it has accomplished this then it has created necessarily a new thing. Otherwise, every incomplete version of the system can be represented by a pattern within it. 


The body responds to the patterns you feed it. It wants to be in homeostasis so it applies different learning techniques to mould you and respond to the environment it finds itself in.

The way in which the body measures this environment and the rules it uses to modify itself are part of you and subject to change between different individuals even though they may be given the same inputs from the environment

For example a dog will inevitably respond to an egg differently than a human will,

So by changing your environment in an unpredictable manner you are not allowing your body to get accustomed to any one patterns. Thus it is in a constant state of learning rather than settling in to a routine. The reason you do not necessarily want to settle is because no one routine will be perfect and overtime by remaining relatively stationary all the errors and faults of that routine will accumulate and exponentiate.

This is why we are inevitably mortal. The die when these problems accumulate beyond reviving. It is the product of our efficiency and the number of reactions that take place inside us.

This is why unpaired electrons can be dangerous. They are chemical reactions waiting to take place and if the wrong reaction occurs then this is a net negative. More wrong reactions occur than right ones obviously otherwise they would be balanced and we would be immortal.
