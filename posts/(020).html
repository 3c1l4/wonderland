<h2> history and comfort </h2>
<h4> 10/01/25  </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,


History has been tarnished by the malicious intentions of misanthropic individuals, as has it been equally coloured by the benevolent sacrifices of saints—but mostly, it has been gradually rusted by the aimless allure of convenience: carelessly pursued by "ordinary" folk.

corruption and salvation cannot merely be sustained by the driven unstable outliers; rather, it must be systemically supported, passively through collective effort that has gradually funnelled to a stable normalcy. 


We forge our roles around a distinct aimless appeal to comfort: marketed as essential, but, in reality, entirely superfluous commodities. It’s okay to be uncomfortable. you are not making a sacrifice to feel discomfort, you are doing yourself a favour when you allow your body to build strength, and more importantly, it makes the system more resilient.

The more in control we can be of our discomforts, whether individual or collective, the less ungovernable suffering we have to endure.


True comfort cannot be forged but rather comes from trust in one another. There is no greater security than knowing you—both and equally—have the means to help those in need, and have a stable and loyal support system; it is an essential faith of sorts that we replace with an aimless devotion to religion and a blind dedication to science.

We thus find ourselves stuck in a perpetual state of denial upon a fictitious model of reality.
