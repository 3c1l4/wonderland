	To Whom it may concern,


The prime numbers exhaust all possible patterns in no particular order. There are infinitely many correct interpretations of how the prime numbers may be patterned and thus there is no way to "predict" the next primes. 


But since there exists a bijection between any given pattern and the prime numbers then they serve as a model for everything!

Which means that figuring out stuff about *other* patterns is just a matter of approximating this bijection with the primes.

I found my focus. I found my thing.

This is it. Im going to work this out: how to map any pattern to the primes.
