	To Whom it may concern,

People will look down at my theory with the same skeptical eyes from the past that they judge. This is likely an inevitability and it may even be centuries (if we even have that long) until what I know I have made will be. 

It is easy to look down at the stupidity of the past with the knowledge we have now. Here, I use knowledge, not as a description of an established objectivity, but rather a more complex interpretation – which, of course, must be relative.

It is also equally as easy to project a vision of the future with the perspective of the present–for had you the true vision of the future, it would cease to be a contingency. There is no way to predict the future, as there is no way to perfectly detail the past, these two axioms may appear to influence each other but they only do so within the confines of a finite segment of space-time.
