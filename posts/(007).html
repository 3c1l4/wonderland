	To Whom it may Concern,


I have so many thoughts I want to dwell on from today's day but not enough time or energy in my brain. Maybe later I will come back and finish this up. It is 7:30 PM, I am sitting after eating and will go shower and maybe go to a live music place tonight with my mom (and brother?). I hiked today with my dad and fucking everyone else on the face of the planet. Uhh that's about it as far as days go. Also I need to talk about that fucking vibrator form yesterday holy smokes. 


Actually not going to go out because I am so tired. Huge sleep deficit right now. Is it just catching up to me, or is it because I am ~exiting menses~? Who the fuck knows, maybe next time I can rule one or the other out, or simply adjust my algorithm. Anyways this is sleepy rambling maybe Ill get to what I wanted to say tomorrow then because right now Im just a bit too tired to get anything productive and thoughtful down. 

But I am feeling a bit poetry-ish. I want to write some pretty snow poems.
