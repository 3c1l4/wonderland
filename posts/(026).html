<h2> layers of abstraction </h2>
<h4> 21/01/25 </h2>

	To Whom it may concern,

Meta patterns in superposition.


The only way to solve the problem is to look at previous layers of abstraction and copy them. They are the pattern fulfilled. Completed (ish). That’s why they are stable and work. We just need to copy that at a higher level of abstraction 

Subatomic particles

Atoms

Molecules

Compounds 

Cells

Tissues 

Bodies 

Communities

Societies

(computers?)

Etc etc. they all model each other because it’s what works 


At the most fundamental layer is a single unit of consciousness. And then every new layer is just a new prime number after all the other patterns were exhausted.
