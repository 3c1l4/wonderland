	To Whom it may concern,

An idea exists in its pure form only for a mere infinitesimal instance; concentrated at a focal epicentre, it is the culmination of all else that encompasses it. Hence, communication–the transmission of an idea–must necessarily abstract it into continuity from its natural state of discreteness. 

As a result, it is not possible to preserve understanding and so, all ideas are necessarily obfuscated by interpretation.

If at any one instance something is discrete, then the rest of the universe must necessarily be continuous to make up for it. This is where metaphorical language can be a tool. It represents everything it is not literally. 

I can try to explain an idea by describing it objectively, or I can try to explain an idea by describing how it is that it should make you feel.

For what is an idea, rather than how it makes one feel?–though stimulus ostensibly exists independent of interpretation, it necessarily does not in our perception.

All interpretations are necessarily valid, as things do not exist objectively apart from perception. Perception needs interpretation and interpretation needs perception.
