	To Whom it may concern,

Why did I decide to start with that sentence, it's so fucking stupid. I guess arbitrary choices must be made every once in a while otherwise we get absolutely nowhere. I wish I could just flip a mental coin to decide things all the time.

Well maybe that's what is going on, with the whole quantum wave function shit. 

Okay I went to the gym, ate lunch and now I've pretty much wasted the whole day, wonderful! Even danced a bit. Sitting at home, fed, and about to go on a date in like 30 minutes. I should be getting ready but also I felt like I needed to relieve some anxiety because Armando saw the letter I wrote and texted me about it and it got me super stressed out, fight or flight ACTIVATED but I have to sit and be pretty now. Fuck. Okay I need to calm down a bit. But I feel like I could go run a fucking marathon right now or cry. Why is this making me so anxious? IDEK what he said it's literally not that deep relax you dummy. Okay this isn't helping I'm going to go get ready.
