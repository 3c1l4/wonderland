To Whom it may concern,

The only way to remove any uncertainty is to remove all confounding variables, so you must necessarily choose things according to some prime pattern.

AKA irrational numbers.

So you must generate some irrational number to encrypt!!

I also have so so many thoughts about symmetries in our world (aka patterns duh) and all the above. 

I can't even explain it all and how important it all is.

Since i'mm stuck here though in this stupid arbitrary world I must figure out how to make the best of it and use this thing to my advantage so that I can feel good.


There is no reason for me to particularly choose feeling good over feeling bad or killing myself. But since I shall die any ways eventually, I might as well just keep doing the life thing.


Just like to be efficient in a sport you have to synchronize all the patterns as much you can (to reduce friction) -- to live longer you need to reduce friction in that way as well..

This is literally the key to longevity.



More importantly why do I want to prove to others that im right so badly? This is just another manifestation of the universe trying to equalize its entropy and go back to perfect symmetry

How absolutely fucking ridiculous this existence is. So cruel --- no no no not cruel, that is just a negative perspective I can choose to ignore -- rather ironic? Or beautiful? I cannot decide whether I want to live a tragedy a romance or a comedy.

I suppose thats all life is, a cycle between these things forever and ever. 



people are all fucking dead because we created the computer and became lazy and stupid


We were on the verge of greatness and we could have had it as humans but we are just passing the torch to the computers because we are too lazy to think about it ourselves. We would rather indulge in hedonic pleasures than think. But fuck, thinking is the most orgasmic pleasure of them all. Is that bad?

If only humans knew what we are giving up to live in these fake easy patterns. Stupid stupid stupid. The future of humanity is so doomed if we don't do something about it. 


This is why we get nowhere, because when people find themselves at this crossroads wherein I no rind myself it is much easier to go seek easy pleasures, like a warm hug from dad and A good cry in a public bathroom

But no, I have to push through and keep this momentum going and immerse myself entirely in this state otherwise it will not get anywhere. 


And I will be just like all the other lazy stupid people. And that's okay-I suppose there is nothing inherently wrong or right about any one way of being. But I don't want to live forever in a goddamn stupid cycle, I want to break free from this one. Why do I want this so badly? 


Well unfortunately I do sort of know the answer to this, and that is just another fucking question, and so on it goes on and on. I just must not get stuck in the cycle of this thought as well, though I may live in this state occasionally, I must also break free from it every once in a while to live the stupid pattern as well, otherwise I will lose track of it and things will roll out of control.
