	To Whom it may concern,

Get people to do an elliptical workout where they’re holding pressure sensor in the right hand and left hand the first trial. They just use the right hand to indicate how difficult it feels aerobically on the second one they do that same thing, but on the left hand there’s a pressure sensor for them to indicate How difficult it is muscularly, and then do control trials like that and then also do it with several different variables together and all combinations of them

We can compare this to their baseline, oxygenation by having them do this at rest while giving them different amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide 

We can then repeat this same type of trial with all the different variables we are looking at such as muscular strength and endurance and what not.

The goal of this would be to find that synchrony thing have them go at different cadences and speeds
