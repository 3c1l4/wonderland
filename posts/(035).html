<h2> god's cruel masturbation</h2>
<h4> 25/01/25 </h2>
<pre> 
	To Whom it may concern,

God is in an eternal battle between wanting to be complete and wanting to have company and so it exists in an infinite state of superposition with itself-lingering in a limbo between a imperfect symmetry and a perfect chaos. 


God is you, god is me, god is the particle, the church, every version of every truth and untruth that exists. because in some interpretation it can't help but being true, as otherwise it would not exist. 


Rule 34: if it exists, there exists porn of it. We are gods cruel (or perhaps beautiful) masturbation-a perverted form of self love. 


Superposition is just fancy talk for masturbation, because GOD FORBID you just stay lonely, no you just need to fucking cum all the time. Stupid universe. Stupid other people. Stupid everything.
