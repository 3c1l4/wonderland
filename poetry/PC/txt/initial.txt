To ensure that which we find, 
no unthunk thought leaves behind
there is an initial condition, 
we must bring to attention.

In the beginning I must
hold faithful trust
that interpret I do 
the same way as you.

For, as if I am blind, 
to what goes in your mind,
and, for, if "it be"– 
as it doth mean to me–

is not the same truth
as "it be" to you,
we lack common sense 
to further attempts

as, to together conclude
I must myself delude
to believe in this "be", 
we identically do speak;

so, in pursuit of the truth
we must already agree 
indeed in these rules
of the deed that is to be.
