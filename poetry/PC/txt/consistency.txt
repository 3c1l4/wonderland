Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they insist,
but it's impossible to deny,
there's a beauty that lies,
in the radius of his eyes,
A faint whisper of Pi,
that draws his to mine.

And they say,
the Golden Ratio was god's finest creation,
but the smooth corners of His face,
down to a Plank's distance of precision,
speak a truth we must embrace:
Fibonacci flows in His veins.
So when god caught His trace,
he made 1.618.

Statistically speaking, He is one in eight billions,
(but we all know, statistics isn't real math).
So, if you really want to know
the authenticity of his brilliance,
observe that his glow
occurs in only one instance
every infinite number of numbers or so.

With the language of truth I am trying to convey,
although it is a working theory, I must say,
you have been part of the proof to me
that it is not so terrible to be.

What they say to me, is that consistency is key,
but it's in His melody where I find my consistency.
