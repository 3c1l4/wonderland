Oh my! What a little guy!
Who have we here?– A small Nill it doth appear.
Oh snore! This Nothing's quite a bore.
I hope it does not hear, but I desire more.
Let me perhaps flip it, hope to make it a little different.

My oh! I see it does not grow...
Ah! It must be symmetric, that is– to my flip– it is indifferent.
But now it seems I find, this flip in-fact's left behind,
two Nills instead of one, and so, One Two instead of none!

My oh me! Geez, we've grown busy!
Nill, One, Two... well, that a full blown party of Three!
Let us now attempt to count, all things that we have thus found:

two Nill – made,
one Two – simultaneously,
one One – and so,
one Three – now there's,
three Ones - thus, alive,
Is a grand total of... Five!

But... something new I must create
to fit this Five into my space...
(Perhaps a seven I shall make?)

Oh me oh my! I am afraid I find,
with each new thing I create, old language from which it came
is inadequate to state, what it is I have thus made!
So, new axiom must become, what old contradiction sung:
to maintain consistency intact, contradiction becomes fact. 

My oh my! Now I need but finite time,
I should have just left it at Nill...
for, now the world has been forever willed to infinitely fill:
deep within the trance of a silly prime number dance.
