Once it starts, it never ends,
and where it ends it starts once again.
So forgive me for diving right in, 
as I have not found the right place to begin, 
anywhere I choose to be 
just in-fact brings about foolishly, 
another lose end to tie up, 
and my knot gets oh so very fucked. 
 
Entertain me for an instant-as that's all it takes–
we will begin with a lone symbol, ∞ (infinity), let's say;
"I am symmetric", this symbol will state,
thus, something new we have inevitably made:
the notion "to be" from our language it came,
but notice "to be" is not what ∞ claimed.

Hence, in our language we have learned to negate.
And so the concept of continuity set the stage
for an intricate infinite dance to take place.
Between "to be" and "not" we inevitably must find
that their dance doth require the creation of "time".

And so from nothing our world is now filled
with these arbitrary entities from which it was built.
Though in reality it does not matter at all
the silly labels of these things that we do call
but to speak in a formal language, you see, 
to have the axiom of choice is the only key.

But why must these logically follow from Nill?–
by symmetry, of course!– the rest will be fulfilled.
For if anything you desire does exist,
the previous rules it must not resist;
but, if there are no previous rules to the game
we find all possible rules must be in play.
