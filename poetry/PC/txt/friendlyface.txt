When we
iterate,
old contradiction,
becomes new axiom;
meaning is acyclically reshuffled,
but we preserve all possible interpretations;
until comes the perseverance of anew logical consistence
within we now find we'd created a new prime!
For we can fit another friendly face
Inside our syllabically
patterned spaces,
to– a whole–
now make.
