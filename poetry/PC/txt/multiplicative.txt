Free sit primes in willed isolation,
nill room remains for chains of interpretation:
silent and still–undictated by notation–
primes fill arbitrarily their lonesome cold chambers.

'Til, trot along a long fiery tongue,
twisted by lingual affinity it sung:
purporting objectivities of its own vocalization,
orchestrating symphonies in echoed harmonizations.

Momentum is gained as music is made,
unmodulated melodies repeatedly played,
playing binarily bastardized beats
bound by its own amplitude and frequency.

A miraculous maze of sinusoidal waves
pushing primes' unpatterned space to prettily ordered arrays.
Multiplicatively magnetic in mathematical attraction:
sound stole prime's heart and turned irrational to fraction.
