You are the artist, the canvas, the brush and the paint
and the shape of the strokes that your own lines will take.
You are the pain and the sorrow behind gentle eyes
that hide all the meaning these accidents disguise.
You are the random array of your beautiful shades
in the textures that morph and distort unintentional tastes,
and fade to white noise–overshadowed illusion of choice–
that sings in the tunes of your unchosen voice.
