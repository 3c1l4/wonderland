<h2> dreams of drear </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
Awake begin all beings once begotten,
born brutally aware they be of all but what's been forgotten:
bad memories frost-bitten by numbing a night’s breeze,
and remembered days drowned by haze of fake fabricated dreams. 

Unwelcomed stays this lulling laze, frothing lids with foggy haze; 
but linger not on day’s dulling wake; fright unlight!– 
feel not afraid, for a deep sleep doth tame: the bright light!–
made weak, to reign thou free from day, 
and succumb now pain to midnight's melodic mame.

Awake beings remain ‘till, in doth seep a fated forsaken sleep,
marish midnight prophecies cast upon day's dawning rays,
a shadow siren that sing, whose music bring promises of frightening freeze.
But, fear not the ease of frozen dreams, for they shan't thou seize sans release, 
but rather, sleep preserve this sweet from spoiling to a sickly rotten,
and dreams of drear all disappear when today's begun with all yesterdays thus forgotten.

Oh, dear!– do not fear- for long lost lessons learned last life still linger near, 
listen carefully, not just with ears, and clear as day yesterday's teachings you'll soon hear.
Awake!– they take ground all around: records burned bound by a scarring sound,
but remember wounds will heal given time, just promise not to pick at scabs with your meagre monkey mind.
