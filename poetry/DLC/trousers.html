<h2> trousers </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
I feel like you want me
and you think that I want you
but I can't feel
and you can't think
so we dance on this brink
dumbfounded by our own foolish instinct
forever in pursuit
of what we can't both feel and know
for it's a quantum mechanic untruth.

We must trade trousers every once in a while
to be reminded where we came,
slowly but surely we will one day fully exchange.
Perhaps when we are both strong enough to take 
each others' hands and dance without vain;
perhaps when we are both secure in ourselves;
when we both think and feel that we truly understand;
when, finally, our hands do collide
we will unglue from time and prance off–
like cats–half alive!
In our entire eternity divine.
