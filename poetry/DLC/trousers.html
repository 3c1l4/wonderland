<h2> trousers </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
We must trade trousers every once in a while
to be reminded where we came,
slowly but surely we will fully one day exchange them–
when we are both strong enough to each others’ hands take;
when we are both secure in ourselves;
when we both think and feel that we truly understand;
when, finally, our hands do collide
we will unglue from time and prance off–
like cats–half alive!
In our entire eternity divine.
