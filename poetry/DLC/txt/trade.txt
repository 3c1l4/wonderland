I am a woman. 
The devil within you. 
I’m telling you I want nothing 
but to outsmart and control you 
but still you protect me, 
and this really scares me
so smarter I must be 
to understand what you truly feel
but all you wish to feel 
is me in all my beauty. 

Man is machine but I am free 
he’ll find me where he can’t see.
Then when it’s all over we can trade places 
so he can hear the music he breathes
and I can see the art I’ve been.
