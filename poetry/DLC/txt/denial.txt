He is looking for his perfect wife
she is the devil that only lies
but when their truths eventually collide
infinite bliss will spread across time.

But she doesn’t exist;
it is only pretend:
for, he secretly knows 
he’s a lonely man,
so love himself he must, 
and instead daydream of her feminine hand.
