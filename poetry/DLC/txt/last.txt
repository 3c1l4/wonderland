In vain of my fate, 
my love they conflate
for, upon my beauty 
they wish to selfishly gaze.
So, they let fear fabricate:
feign desire to hate.

But, me?—
I want to be free. 
To be I— 
unchained from sky, earth and sea;
to escape: fly away, set sail, and dig deep;
Mind, World, and Body all within me. 

But don't you worry, 
I'll save the last dance for you
just do not question 
the intention of my truth
for, the more you fear 
the further I'll be near.
So make your choice:
Do you let me be?
Do you give me a voice,
so I may speak 
the directions to steer
and you may find 
your home in my sea?

Just don't fear the reverse of my word,
because I promise to save the last dance for thee.
