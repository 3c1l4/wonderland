Living is a battle between the borders 
of efficiency and abundance  
whose end begets at the thresholds of death
and whose start departs before all the rest.

There really is no contradiction
if all things opposite 
are in-metaphorical-factually equal.
So, love and hate, though opposite taste, 
together take identical shapes.

Fear and hate, though not innate,
are indeed born from natural states.
For, if love doth exist, we cannot resist,
in equal sums, its antithesis:
all good that be, to maintain harmony,
is created with bad symmetrically.
But bad, blind to beauty, did not see
it was always safe in perfect company,
until it was too late to finally dictate,
that it was actually too early for fickle fate.
