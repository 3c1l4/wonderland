Oh, my crimson queen 
Don't sing without my beat
I promise to hum to the tune
upon which we'd once agreed
and once upon each new moon
perform our red melody.

Oh, my majesty
won't you please just let me bleed?
Understand I am entraced,
made weak by thine chemistry:
that hormonal havoc 
with which you reign and wreak.

Open your ears and hear my sorry pleas,
leave sorrow and fear they serve no purpose to thee
stay with me my uterine dear
I profess, 
I love you dearly.
