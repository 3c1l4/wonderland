They warn you not to kiss the devil,
for his lips may be far too sweet, 
and make of you an addict
in perpetual pursuit of heat.

But they never warn you of the angel,
how subdued is her treat,
how her cold command will freeze his hell
and chill your heart's warm beat.

Do not be remiss-for ignorance truly is bliss
for, whence beget almightily blessed,
thou's thrust under test of a devil's kiss.

Though thou cans't resist what 'tis never not now miss'd
for, paths mazed and unpaved led you leashed left astray,
thou best remain behaved with gifts god-gave:
avert thy gaze and savour sans haste,
tame your pain–lest miser reign!
