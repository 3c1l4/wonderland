There is something a little blue about your solemn hue
let me bring my ink and stain it frequencies more pink.
Let me polish to perfection the echoes etched in
the pitches reflected in our purpled complexion
let me unseperate the primaries of our pretty paints
and remove the speckled stains of yesterday's petty pains.

Let us intertwine and tie our tongues in dance divine:
advance in complex untraceable steps that silhouette
the violent violet shape of overshaded days
In this tango trance of our lovely lavender romance.
