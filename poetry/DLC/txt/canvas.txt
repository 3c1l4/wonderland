You are the artist, the canvas, the brush and the paint
and the shape of the strokes that your own lines may take.
You are the pain and the sorrow behind gentle eyes
that hide all the meaning these accidents disguise.
You are a rainbow array of beautiful shades
in textures that morph and distort unintentional tastes,
and fade to white noise–overshadowed by choice–
that sings in the illusory tune of your voice
to the only melody that life's sound can make.
