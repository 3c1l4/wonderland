Oh, dearest me, dost thou not love thee? 
Why must these sins you play on repeat–
cyclically–broken record of jarring melodies:
earth shattering infidelity! 
Why can’t thou be loyal to me?: 
Always addicted to all you can't be.

Mind made is this dreadful dark place: 
thin slivers fight sneakily to shine, 
squeeze through bounds of radial of pupils of mine
eyes: bright and round — insight profound, 
inside swim silver puddles of lingering light, 
flooding with might my miniature gardens 
fierce fiery fearless delight. 
But mind made the night to drown heavy weight 
of sights unseen—boiled by heat—
in height of day.

Oh, cruel nature why dost thou curse me needless greed, to headlessly heed this unforgivingly sick vanity?
Make mirrors to my reflections see, yet lest bless me to wistfully peek, these beautiful eyes of mine which thoust endow sight to see?
Why dost thou shape me, with your infinite tastes, yet twist me into temporal body and with eternity tease?
What an ignoble deed indeed, for an ostensibly divine entity!
