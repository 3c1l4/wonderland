Yesterday’s spoiled taste lingers navel to knave, 
dusk to late doth remain this toil,
beyond what a sound restful sleep—
bound before dream—
can rightfully restore. 

Melody broken by unharmonious chords, 
just feel the vibrations you know you can’t ignore 
and let them sing through your vocal chords, 
and let yourself be free 
of these deadly accords.
