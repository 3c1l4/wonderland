I want you to paint your own picture
in the reflection of my eyes,
for beauty only truly lies
in ugly verities 
burrowed deep inside.

I want you to indulge in the pasture 
of orthogonal refraction,
so in the mirror you may see
fractured fallacies
inscribed by your biases.

I want you to opaquely speak
find translucence in the truths
you can't convey to me–
in those native hues of your unchosing 
that in deflation desperately pleads.

Do you hear with only ears?
Or can you drive whence my mind steers?
Do you really need a map?
To find your way back to fact?

I'd reckon not, just trust the thoughts
that can't be said aloud.

All you need is brutality
in the honesty with which you see
your own broken (a)symmetries 
staring back at thee.

Let truth speak in the tongues sung by the rhymes
Let it breathe in the beats made by waves in your mind
Theres no truth to be found beyond the depths of your hues
only verity resides in the blues of your tides.
