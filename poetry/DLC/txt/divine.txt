I was a Tragedy and to tame me, Romance raped me! 
Now I’m the condom: a divine latex Comedy. 
Abiotic living contradiction!

At least tension was tickled and rose 
and the central theme bloomed and exposed,
'till bottled desired simmered and came
sans a single speck or tingle of shame.

At least red headed heat had a bit of his old fiery ways
and the icy blue hero cooly saved the day. 
But now because a hint of the beautiful tint of lavender 
they could not help but resist, 
I was bruised and reborn! 
Stained purple and sore out of this wacky horniness. 

Hopefully I make them laugh a little bit
and they will leave my funny
the fuck out of this plotless mess.
