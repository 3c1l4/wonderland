Day: Fight for the right to wake through the night 'gainst magnetic might of thine heavy sight–

Night: Unseen!–revealed, only in dreams; with eyes sealed you'll see: there's no reason in fright–

Day: But fear be blind; peel thine eyes open wide, to spite dark skies with the brightness of light–

Night: Like a feather take flight!–with ease, soar breeze that deep sleep doth ignite–

Day: 
Aflame: my day will melt freezing pain, away from whence dark dawn 'twas it made.

Night: Nigh! Not ere doth your claims appear, this heat ablaze has boiled your brains! My dear, stay here, and rest dusk away.
