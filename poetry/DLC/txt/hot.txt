My lovely, my lovely, I am so sorry
the devil hath fucked thee, in all of thine glory.
Tits touched by thick thrusts of those tongue twisted lips,
and peachy pink pussy petted unpretty by his hot crimson stick.
Forgive me my darling, I only let this be out of fear
that you may never return to my icy cool blue revere.

I must ask now, my darling, was it frozen or boiling:
the touch of your skin last you were horny?
I do not want to know if you came, just tell me my angel:
is it I or the devil that hath now your soul tame?
