Do not be remiss-for ignorance truly is bliss
for, whence beget almightily blessed,
thou's thrust under test of a devil's kiss.

Though thou cans't resist what 'tis never not now miss'd
for, paths mazed and unpaved led you leashed left astray,
thou best remain behaved with gifts god-gave:
avert thy gaze and savour sans haste,
tame your pain–lest miser reign!
