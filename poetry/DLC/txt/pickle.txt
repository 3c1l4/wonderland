Yesterday’s spoiled taste lingers late navel to knave.
dusk dawns to-day and still remains this bittering toil
beyond what a sound restful sleep—even bound in a dream—
can rightfully restore. 

So, knee deep you soak 
in acidic brine unsub<I>lime</I>,
and bathe thee in citric steep’d salty tea 
utterly vinegary:
a jarring confine sans sweet escape.
Submerging your soul
deep down you dive, 
to depths of cumbersome tickles of tang 
that saltily hold and drown you alive. 

Tell me, 
is the freshness you trade
for no best before date 
worth the pickling pain
that soaks in your veins?
Tell me,
does this shelf stable fate
truly savour your taste
or did you corrode your born flavour
to be devoured in vain?
As ‘twere you really all the same—
perhaps just a little less green,
and a little more sour–
than your crunchy cucumber'd state.
