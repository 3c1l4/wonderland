Yonder day, as it doth get late,
‘tis but a neut unyielding game.
Par, not greed nor haste, command your pain:
for, what thou shan’t forcefully give
The world shalt willingly take.

Beyond the light, amidst dark night,
seal sleeping eyes open wide.
Let not with daze, away lids laze:
for, poison chosen, thou shan't mistake,
in drunken haze for unpicked fate. 

Lest, never not thou rest–
nor phallic fate await–
for, thou shalt greet what 'tis you seek;
instead, fly free!- 
For anew nest find thee,
uncaged.

It is only the pursuit of forever that shall chain thee.
