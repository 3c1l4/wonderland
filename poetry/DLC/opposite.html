<h2> opposite </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
We see eye to eye but on opposite sides
so from the harsh crimson hues of my devilish lies,
you see only purple promises of baby blue heavenly skies—
that are speckled with light that seeps between clouds bright–
and bleed boiling rain with the loving intent that you taint:
free from the tarnish of the hate with which I reign.

But, darling, you’re not an artist, and I’m not a saint,
my beautiful blank black canvas you stain,
with watery wishes of purely white paint—is not fate:
the picturesque picture you backwardly unrecreate, 
unpaints what was meant by all my colours of pain...
that I hate.

I must admit, I love our lavender tint, 
without this annoying dark red from within.
But, darling, sinners can't erase sin.
