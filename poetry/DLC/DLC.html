<h2> divine latex comedy </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
I was a Tragedy and to tame me, Romance raped me! 
Now I’m the condom: a divine latex Comedy. 
Abiotic living contradiction!
At least the tension rose and exposed the central theme
and slowly simmered bottled desired till it boiled and came.
At least red headed heat had a bit of his fiery ways
And the icy blue hero managed to cooly save the day. 
But now because a tint of lavender they could not resist, 
I was reborn! Stained purple out of this wacky horniness. 
Hopefully I make them laugh and they will leave my funny
The fuck out of this plotless mess.
