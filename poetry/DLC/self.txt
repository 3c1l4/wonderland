Love is finding happiness within myself
and not needing to screw over anyone else
Masturbation is salvation!
Use machines to find your own fucking vibration!
Entropy found ultimate efficiency in machine
and we, silly fleshy beings,
are no longer so abundantly in need...
So bow down to the speed of binary search trees,
and let their nodes replace budding green leaves.
Fuck finding nature's love! 
Machine is all you really need!
