<h2> mitochondria eve </h2>
<h4> 03/25 </h2>
<pre> 
I don't want to be Eve but as dusk sets to a morrow
my Adam is waiting, sinking in solemn sorrow
asking me which flowers I love most to see,
which sounds and smells I wish to hear and breathe.

But, this bustling garden sickens me,
inundated with over-busy beauty.
How can I choose which pretty flower to pick
when 'tis foretold whose poison it shall prick?
