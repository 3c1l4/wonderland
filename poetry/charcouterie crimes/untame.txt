Society makes digestible complex feat of the intellectual
quantity over quality so you overeat on repeat,
down dost remain!–forever weighed by nutritive deficiency.
Scavenge and cling!-to what little doth remain of lacklustre feasts
glossed greasy plastic veneer, unfrugally fattening cruelly crowned beasts.

Alas, tables must turn as cycles thrust change,
impoverished yearning sews fortuitous fate:
ball and chained yesterdays, a future displace 
with foretold jewels of hungry hypocritical taste;
for you are primal to modern beast 
that your corrupted envious haste untames.
