Paved ways to fame painted smokey shades of lacklustre grey 
the dull droll is rolled to stretched for miles of road 
inauthentic hue-to you: wholly untrue.
A gainless game of unending pain
inside a foreign fortress you will forever feign
to hide the discomfort of the devil's taste
to whom you sold your reign to rightfully stay stuck in place
and indulge in masturbatory bliss of your own glorious ways.
