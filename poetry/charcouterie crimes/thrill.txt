I was in it for the thrill of the chase
but my energy was drained to nill 
so please forgive me my prey 
but I had to go for the kill.

Lest, never in vain 
for my tank has now been filled,
and my hand—though cruelly twisted by hungry fates—
learned me a lesson:

I’ll feed ‘fore our next game,
and turn the hunt into fun
for all that wish to play.
