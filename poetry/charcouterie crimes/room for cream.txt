Secretly you dream to leave room for cream
but half and half is bound to make you fat.

Secretly you wish to replace aspartame
with nature’s golden honey glaze,
but sugar free are your coffee and tea,
Echoing dreadfully dark dreams in the pitcher of this black caffeine
to shake you clean from the waking nightmares 
Fro which you can't care to be freed–
for lest thee conflate energy sweet
with a pitcher of peacefully blocked adenosine.
Brewed boiling and bitter to save you space
for one more mug to trick your brain awake.
Consumed at dawn, at dusk only half gone–
stimulate! awake! Do not rest your mindful state!
