Utterly cheesy and insufficiently meaty
totally nightmarish charcuterie party.

Sprinkled sparsely with crumbs that lack toasting
and coated with uncured salmon left unroasting,
certainly it must be only salmonella you plan hosting.
Not nearly nutty nor nectarine enough

totally fit for the unflavourful nuts 
that saltily savour your wits and asphyx
all the guests with your dreadful trail mix. 

Only flatulent fate awaits 
from all this feta
inundating our plates 
and these freeze dried 
strips of steak
with years past due 
best before dates

this stinky bologna 
Is shaped scarily holey 
boned like Swiss dairy 
and untastily phoney!
worse than canned ham–
from spam to pemmican–
just spamming to board with 
unholy shelf stable sham!

My tummy is tingled with tickles
from your neon green olives and pickles
And your sauerkraut bellows too loud
And drowns cheesy yellow 
With the green in its shout!

these dips don't dip, they only stick
to tortilla chips one dares not lick

Lacklustre honey mustard,
how did you manage to muster 
enough courage to serve this
funny orange looking custard?
It's colour almost catches up to ketchup

If only you had worked on perfecting your rolls and buns 
Instead of sticking so much fluff between your droll  puns
Maybe then id like to be 
A guests at your next charcuterie
