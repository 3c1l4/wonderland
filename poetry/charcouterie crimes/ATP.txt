Attempts to tame the burning pain
are icy breaths exhaled in vain:
yield not to fire!–mind doth respire,
lungs scream out–simmer back reign!–
Unshield the body!–daggers back desire–
charred by mind's game, they inhale flame.

Exposed cavity now boiled by heat
bleed into vein and blood saturate.
Retreat, retreat!—in pulsing beats,
repeat the heart whose strength doth fade.
Inundate away!—the mind exclaims,
cardiac rhythm resigns to (brain)wave. 

Somatic soldiers sent a-surge to slay,
and in crimson tidal waves doth circulate.
Cells aligned, intentionally designed,
march side by side in pituitary array.
In synchrony they dance to free,
with sweet release, chemical energy: ATP.
