If sparkling alloys and rusting toys
is where you find your inner voice
to sing your melody–
to orchestrate your joy and glee, 
Then who am I to pout and frown?— 
your precious smile, to try to drown?
Who am I to forcefully 
take innocence away from thee?

If it really is these little things 
that makes your heart truly sing, 
Then who on earth am I to say
that you should try not be this way? 

It doth appear I do not know 
for what it is your bells truly toll— 
but, if shiny treats is what you seek, 
then my dear, it will not be you and me,
with whom which we find each what we need.
