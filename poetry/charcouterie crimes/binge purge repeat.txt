Binge purge repeat,
your secret treat:
fight urge to feast
for right to feed.

Boneless meat
you scarf with ease
comes right back up 
with fluidly;

meatless bones
your body's toned
with hues of hungry
coloured by your disease. 

Binge purge repeat,
promises of last defeat:
just one more plate
and one more release.

Bonne Appetite
the satiety you seek
in the trigger happy 
bathroom retreat.

You fill to find sate
and empty to please.
Eat not for taste
but for satiety.


forever unfree of urge to eat
you await weightless sate
of impossible cake:
sweetness feigned
by fake aspartame taste
Just have the fucking cake 
it won't bite: make no mistake.
