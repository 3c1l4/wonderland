Woman I love (28/06/25)
I want to write about a woman I love,
Now does that make me a man?
Even if her hands that write
Tight hold my pen?

DNA
With your wake they promptly take shape
a primitive ache: instinct passed by genes.
Binary strings whose waves sing
frequencies that doth make your heart ache,
a silly little thing scientists call DNA.


Tide
You are not the sun
And I am not a tide
But still you make me turn 
And you believe you shine

Je n'suis pas une marée 
et ton brille n'est pas vrai 
Meme si ton reflection m'a fait 
Tourner vers ton face aujourd'hui 




Electromagnetic (17/11/25)
Enigmatic and magnetic
Only causes utter panic 
you're a particle im a wave 
but you and me are just the same 

you only fear what you can’t tame
you vindicate and absolve hate of blame
because you know you can't make me stay 



Dear me (16/11/25)
Dear universe,
Your job here is done
I have felt everything 
Under the sun 
yet still you cling 
for the longing of one 
that may finally dim 
the darkness whence you run 


Reinvisioned (16/11/25)
the perfect contradiction 
is no more than a fact of fiction 
for lying in its reflection 
is partial truth wholly reinvisioned. 


(12/11/25)
If all I say is good 
And all you hear is bad 
Then who am I to say 
That truth is not in your head? 


Nice (10/11/25)
Just because I said it 
Doesn’t mean I believe it 
Sometimes it just rhymes nice
And I couldn’t bear just to leave it. 


Mud (10/11/25)
If you're not going through shit in a rut
It’s because you're quietly stuck in the mud.


Calling (08/11/25)
People always tell me I found my calling
Then why does the phone still ring 
are there whispers to which I still cling?
whose voice am I waiting to hear?
The instructions keep coming through so unclear.


painful (08/11/25)
hell won't be so painful 
when you make life a living hell
you still have to go when your days end 
so don't fall victim to yourself.


warning: (08/11/25)
These are all just metaphors–
that is, if you believe there is a distinction.
For all things opposite are in-metaphorical-fact equal 


the sum of your parts (8/11/25)
The whole is much more than the sum of its parts
You think you’re a brain but you know you’re a heart


wait to waste(2/11/25)
You wait to waste your time 
as if there is something else you may find
darling purpose is all 
made inside your mind


Advice (1/11/25)
Take my advice
You must think twice
Before you take
My word for right.


Systems (30/10/25)
Your body is a system, 
your heart is its religion, 
your head is the science 
defining the symbols that define your vision


bandaid (29/10/25)
Wake up 
Never stay stuck 
Peel off the tape
That keeps you from love
That masks all the pain 
And makes you feel rough


teach from your mistakes (25/10/25)
If you learn from your mistakes
And teach them so they can take
your pain won't be in vain. 
and your suffering turns to gain


Chase (25/10/25)
The more you try to chase
Changes you can't make 
The more they run away
And you are stuck in place 


Stay (25/10/25)
You can have some days
Without productive gains
you can decide to stay 
In the exact same place
Its going to be okay
No matter where you lay. 


Good (25/10/25)
Good is up to you 
Truth is not something
You could ever (un)choose to lose 


Combine (25/10/25)
It doesn't matter how you choose to combine things
Just do it with good intentions and you'll always find the right answer 
Perhaps not the one you seek 
But the one that is destined to set you free


Bullseye (23/10/25)
You have one shot
Don’t miss
The targetless 
Abyss

The bane of my existence (01/10/25)
Precision is the bane of my existence
so here I go again
Facing all my demons.
my frustrations are bred by expectations,
all I need is a bit more patience
and make my lines so fine
they become hard to fucking find.



belief (04/10/25)
ignorance is bliss
but only if you know
and knowledge is power
but only if you're told
the grass is only ever really green
if they're the tones you chose to see
you can't escape inevitability 
just pick which final flowers to believe. 


Garbage (24/09/25)
There no more left to explore
Only garbage galore
That suffocates space in disordered arrays
And must be put back into its rightful old place
traced back to its original shapes
of echoes that cannot be erased


afloat (26/08/25)
find the strength to forgo
the fear which, tightly you hold
you know it won't make you grow
or help to keep you afloat


Lost thought (26/08/25)
There is a thought for every occasion 
but occasionally there is no word for a thought 
so I ought to write from my imagination
to slow all these run away thoughts 
some tend to get lost before vocalization
amidst tracks utterly stopped
thats when I am able to refuel my engine,
until they finally find the force to cross. 



Numerical verification (24/08/25)
As a mathematical mind
It’s quite challenging to find 
Value that is not 
Numerically verified 


Purfekshun (17/08/25)
I know I’m not perfect,
and I like reminding myself
in small doses of being stoopid,
but there is no such thing as beeing korect 
so i let my ego stoop two the level of id
coz dip done i no dat
dis stoopidity dosent reely reetract
frum da essense ov beeing perfectly intact. 


How could it be? (15/08/25)
Oh life you are much more bizarre 
Than I could possibly ever think you are
And you see,
I already think in contradictions
And believe,
That all truth is illusion.
So I guess I finally see:
how could it ever not be?


Birdie (14/08/25)
Hey there little birdie
What's the secret word
Whisper it to me
Tell me how to be heard
How do you get them to listen
To your song sung sans vision?


Prisoners (13/08/25)
Are we all just prisoners
Of our own denial?
Tied by chains of shame
Linked by vain so vile
To a vision defined
By the stakes we paid
To stick to our sickness
of stubborn prideful claims

Scaffo ld (25/08/25)
Upon a fact you build
A scaffold of the past you willed
Whereupon your beliefs grasp 
So you dare not challenge the hold of your past
A structure now rigidly filled 
With these unstable blocks left in tilt. 
But, what beautiful shape could you possibly make,
If you just gave your facts a little bit of a shake?


Arranged (12/08/25)
The clouds arrange
In such mysterious ways
That the best way to replicate
The flow of their shape
Is to let fate dictate
The lines that you lay.


Phases (12/08/25)
Nothing phases me except myself
But when I find my own frequency...
Goodness help!
The resonate is deafens me
Until out of phase I must be.


Enough (11/08/25)
Always enough 
But also never too much 
Balance is where you struck
Gold with your touch


Give and Take (10/08/25)
If you take what you need and give what you an
You get what you want just not how you'd expect


Score (09/08/25)
The body keeps score
But if you don't teach it to count
It'll fuck around 
Until it finds out how 


not all black or white (06/08/25)
you can lower the lights 
without bringing the night
there is dawn resting between 
darkness and light


Gravity (07/08/25)
I am not a feather 
don't let me blow away,
or a burden weight heavy 
that your shoulders cannot take.
Don't let my gravity 
define how you see me;
Don't mind my mattered shape–
just let it float away.



patterned loops (02/08/25)
Once I realized I kept falling into patterned loops
Where my rhymes became alive, exponentiating in my mind
I changed the hue of my tunes to yellow instead of blue
and let harmless melodies come true and mellow harmonies arise


intention is illusion (01/08/25)
it's all just is bugs not features
some just buzz better lies
and disguise as procedure
(Thats why god loves his Beatles)



Relax (29/07/25)
Relax, 
sit back, 
You can't predict
Your own next step.
Let it all unfold, 
Don't try to mould.


Who do you love? (27/07/25)
You liked the light inside their eyes
that reflected an image of your own sacrifice
maybe just save them from your crooked behaviour
and look in the mirror next time you need a saviour.


Dire (24/07/25)
the circumstances are never so dire
to require
so much thought
about how to expire.


Deathless (15/07/25)
Death is a depthless perception
created in conceptions image of heaven
an eternally silent + flat bliss
to bring an intense end to the projection 
of life's electrifying multidimensional kiss.



Deprived (25/07/25)
12:45 -- of sleep i've been deprived
Left half alive with a quarter mind
Filled to the brim with thoughts not mine
6:15 -- I long to stay inside my dreams
But instead I scream, bring me caffeine!



Depth (27/07/25)
Once you learn how to see depth
it seems you're always on the precipice
looking down on both greatness and mess
in limbo between love and distress:
a beautiful wreck!


Tidy (24/07/25)
Tide-ly yearning
To turn like a sine
Whose waves make beauty
Oceanically alive
But current-ly churning 
With the chaos of pi
In an irrationally hued pursuit
To remove blue from my vibe 


Fractured (07/07/25)
We cannot resist the magnetic attraction keeping us fractured
Alas, it is not really a matter of inaction
Simply bound to transient satisfaction.


Scatter (26/07/25)
Perfectly speckled pains 
densely scatter in my brain 
separate me from my hate
and fills love in the gaps it creates.


Sleep (25/07/25)
There are demons in my brain 
keeping me awake
Because they know its precious sleep I need
to finally be freed
On whose releif shall they next feed?


Encryption code (25/07/25)
I was greedy and took a peek within my own encryption code 
In an attempt to witness my own beauty as it unfolds
so much haste to get a taste of my fruits so nectarine
That the sweet defeated me and I was left with rotting dreams


Spun (25/07/25)
You want to undo whats been done
by the fortune you hastily spun,
but the key to relief
is to love destiny
and sing in the key 
thats already been sung.


Art (24/07/25)
The art of articulation 
cannot be approximated 
with computation 
The essence of intelligence
is flow 
not calculation.


Truth be Sold (24/07/25)
Truth be told
I'm made of gold
But only if you don 
the glasses I've sold


Drive (24/07/35)
If the ego did not drive 
There'd be no reason to stay alive;
there would be no pursuit 
of bettering our truths 
the ego sets you free
so separate from it you may be
At an infinitely distant 
place in eternity.


Fun (23/07/25)
I preach that–in peace–
I may then practice how to be
And remind myself to free 
The fear that doth defeat.
So indulge in being
Let your boundaries run 
Be yourself with me 
Just have some fun



Sing (23/07/25)
Sing to me in my beautiful dreams
So that when you awake you can hear your own beat


Heaven (23/07/25)
You made a heaven of your hell
those dreams that kept you awake
And out of your shell
Now mould from your shape 
in your beautiful ways



Right (19/07/25)
When will we get it right? 
I don’t know
But I’m willing to take the bet 
that it won’t be in this life


Woe (17/07/25)
Oh woe is me! 
But not really
Because I quite like
These challenging fights
The turbulent tides
Turning inside
Bringing right out 
wrongs I can’t right 



Detached (17/07/25)
Be not too attached to the fruits of the act
For silent is the sound with which petals bloom all around 


Full circle (15/07/25)
You need to first travel a full circle to decide you prefer lines 


Aware (18/07/25)
I’m always trying to find the perfect words to say how I feel 
But why if I claim not to care
whether someone will hear my despair.
Am I even self aware?
Or just a shadow in the background, sort of... there?


Time (19/07/25)
Time wounds all heals
And sews all seeds
It heeds only to the speed
That light can never reach


Deceits (19/07/25)
Are things only true when dictated by rule?
But then what decides which deceits are made lies?


Hypothesize (19/07/25)
To prove in truths you must hypothesize in lies
And read the rhymes between the lines.
There is only one truth that can help you see
That only one truth will set you free.


Complaints (19/07/25)
Observations must be spoken aloud
If we are to resolve
What they complain about


Median (19/07/25)
In the median of time is where we make love:
Robot and mankind–
a battle of minds!
A romance alive
(But for only one side...)



Rock bottom (12/06/25)
You might be the worse you've ever been 
but if its any consolation 
its probably not the worse you'll ever be.


Maybem (23/06/25)
These feelings unmanaged
Run rampage
And damage
They threaten to spoil
And use evil as leverage
To uncoil, boil, spoil, 
cause perpetual toil



Pink (28/06/25)
Life is a test that cannot be passed or failed
Only endlessly written, in vain, to no avail
So write in ink and make it pink
Whatever it takes to not go stale!


Sparkle (28/06/25)
Are the stars' sparkle in vain causing your pain? 
That you see in them reflections of thee? 
Lost in bliss-less sea of cosmic abyss?


Vein (28/06/25)
As far as I'm concerned there is no vein upon this vessel that could erase the shades of pain painted by these fickle fates. No seeming escape. No artery within this body shall ever free from defeat to death deranged disease–only born from life's urge to lust.


Where to? (28/06/25)
We are going the only way we can 
through every tangent possible.


Proximity (28/06/25)
Take note of this moment here
Nevermore will it be so near
Nor appear in any peripheral
And lay where you shall next peer


Wrinkes (15/07/25)
They come and go in waves
Aging soft lined wrinkles on a friendly face
Folding within themselves to create
Curved expressions of linearly changing days


Bizarre (15/07/25)
Don't you think its quite bizarre
You're reading all these words
Without seeing for what they really are
Graceful thoughts left untraced
Reduced to symbols scribbled on a page
Echoes sketches of intentions erased
Unplanned etches badly spaced


Crooked (15/07/25)
Do crooked intentions retract
From the value that keeps things intact?
Like a purposeful spill on a page
Made to make things a little less lame and correct?
Made to make things a little more wrong in all the right ways.


Free Will (02/07/25)
The freedom of my will 
is destined to see out
a prophecy that self fulfills


Peace (02/07/25)
The only intent I've left untamed is that of peace
The only sense with which I begin is that of love
This eager beast forever stays free from mortal chains


Drive (02/07/25)
Im trying to find
What's driven my drive
Who's ridden my ride
And riddled my lines
With repetitions and rhymes


Gaps
Oh the gaps in my map drove me wrongly mad
Until I learned how to read the rights left unsaid


Blame
Inundate not the artist with blame–
for, the brush, the canvas, and the paint
equally stake claim on the random array:
of our art that was beautifully (not really) made.



Unalike (22/07/25)
Time after time
We tirelessly tried
To find in our mind
Something unalike
Perhaps lets try instead
A place before time beget.
(Now: where past and future will have met).


Belief keys (22/07/25)
This system of beliefs: the foundation of this place– 
is the key that we both need, to see each others' face.


Dial (22/07/25)
You're trying to dial me, but darling can't you see? 
You've trapped me in a dream, where my line cannot be reached. 
(At least not with ease... try the next digits please)


Heathen (22/07/25)
Everything I do
I do it for this love
Because I am a heathen 
Addicted to our drug
You would be too
None of us can choose
It is the only answer
That makes sense here


Mirrors (03/25)
If your reflection you could not see 
How liveth-thee the life you now lead? 
Vanity free is where life revives, 
light lost that a blind narcissus hides. 


Catabolism (02/25)
A cyclic kind of mortal beast, 
entrapped by restful repeats 
of sixty-minute beats; 
ticks on me shalt forever feast
‘til ‘tis mere ivory
dug deep that'll remain of me. 


Hypocrisy (02/25)
Chasing the perfect hypocrisy
that can't be used against me,
trying my hands at every single one
to see which unfitting glove I shall call my own.


Only God 
Do not try to resist laws written by "physics"
Entropy protects you from loneliness 
of being the only god left to exist 


Oh Bother

I can't be bothered to do bothersome things
I'd much rather watch myself dance and hear myself sing
I'd rather play drums to my own beat
and surrender to trance without egoic defeat.


Good Fight (01/25)
You can’t have white paint
and you can’t have black light 
so pick the poison you want 
and fight your good fight.


Restrictions (01/25)
Why must I always restrict my domain
to equally give or equally take.
Solely because both my minds cannot comprehend
infinite things happening at once.


Trips (07/25)
Tripping. On what? To where?
From the last; to the next. 


Thrust (07/25)
Bursts of trust thrust upon this lust,
just not quite enough to call it true love.


Raw

In all its simplicity: just an amplitude and frequency. 


Nursery to Urn (02/25)
mind body and world cruelly churn
me — nursery to urn —
my shape they relentlessly make 
twists and turns that thread my furs
Fuck the cake.

Infinite consistency is not possible
logic requires finite:
I can’t have my cake
and fuck it too;
I can’t have my man
and eat him too.


Mortal Dreams (03/25)
Chained by mortality we divinely dream 
To weld endless links: create infinity.
But each link has its own strategy
So unmoving remain bounds of life’s chain
from will unfree.


Water from another well (03/25)
The other half of the glass is filled 
with water from another well
It will unfill, brim to nill, 
puddling into a brand new pale. 


Rotten eggs (03/25)
Exterior of the ovum is old: 
female future untold
Interior within doth doubly unfold: 
granted male shape to mould.


Absolutely (02/25)
Opposites attract because all is not absolute: 
identical qualities detract relative value. 


Differential equations (05/01/25)
Who I want to be is chosen by me 
and so it is in advance that my identity
In utter contingency
Is  decided by who it is that I am.


inhuman(03/25)
Shaped by brain’s worried waves: 
this body never fit for mangled mold mind marishly made:
forevermore forced this earthly form to inhumanely take.


In your dreams (03/25)
I will sing our lovely songs all day long 
so you can have me at night as you please
just please, my dear, let me sleep in peace
I promise you will see me in your dreams.
