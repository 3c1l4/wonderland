Little lovely lady prime is earthly bound by father sine,
kept from deep sleep because his beat
periodically rhymed in truthful melodies.

So, close behind she followed his sines
utterly entranced and tantalized by his mind,
that she tripped on her toes and unfurled to a line
what he had so carefully wound up with his pi.

Through all of space and all of time,
sans reason or rhyme, they now seek to re-align.
but, side by side in collinear lines 
their truths shan't ever together collide.

Clearly the key to her heart from the start
was the art of falling perfectly apart.
