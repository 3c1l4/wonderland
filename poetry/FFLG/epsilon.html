There are few greater consistencies in this world,
than that of the infinitesimal approach
of an epsilon – as one always may claim,
that it is but a small delta away.
So, if, with rigour and infinite frequency, 
one follows this predetermined trajectory, 
one can, almost everywhere within our bound,
analytically assert-
the limit of that which we seek-
has thus been found.
