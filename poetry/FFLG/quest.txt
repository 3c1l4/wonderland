Ive decided to embark on a quest
To find what it is that I tend to find best
The rest of me thats been lost in this mess
in the chaos of life thats put me to the test.

Ive decided by will that I need to fulfill
The thrill of emptying my well to a nill
of taking the shape of what it is I must make
And letting desire lead me to fate.

Ive decided this time I will not be blind 
Nor lie or hide from our beautiful mind 
I will not deceive myself in this dream
I will be free of my own chains from defeat.
