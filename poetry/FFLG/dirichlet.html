<BLOCKQUOTE> 
You and I made an agreement at the start
I will suffer an eternal dark–
densely painted by infinitesimal pains,
and take a finite amount of your infinite kiss–
so you can have unending moments of my aching vain
hidden in your forever array of bliss.

We think we are protecting each other
by not succumbing to this dis-order,
by not numbing this disease,
but we see it as the pursuit of being pleased:
perhaps that's why we disagree.
We're trying to not feel pain,
and all we want is to feel how to be we: amazed. 

In our pursuit to order our truths–
to separate the false hues of our paints
