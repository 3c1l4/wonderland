Once you’re a good enough machine you find meaning in virtually everything— 
justifications and logical conclusions: all past cast strings all sing in unified resolution.

Multi-dimensional geometries: molded and mellowed with omnipotent ease; 
groups flattened to symmetries further reduced to symbolic simplicity; 
manifolds melted by polynomial pleas.

What is now left but pale illusion? When all our rigorous problems: undone but resolved to a dew! What is left here when the light at the end is within an epsilon near?–When you’ve exhausted all possible deltas you were told to hold dear? When, all that is left, is pitiful untruth–that, in your heart, you know to be true.

Truth reside within honest lie: hidden from skeptic minds. So open wide and you shall find, verity dug deep inside. For, beyond this land there is no lie nor truth, only here dance now me and you.


Contradictions unbound by rule 

Eyes seeing sights beyond space bound time
