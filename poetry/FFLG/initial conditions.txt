To ensure that which we find, 
no unthunk thought leaves behind
there is an initial condition, 
we must bring to attention.

In the beginning I must, 
hold faithful trust
that interpret I do, 
the same way as you.

For, as if I am blind, 
to what goes in your mind,
and as for if "it be" – 
as it doth mean to me –

is not the same truth
as "it be" to you,
then we lack common sense 
to further any attempts

to together conclude.
Thus, I must delude
myself to believe, 
of an identical "be", 
we indeed do speak;

so, in pursuit of what is true
we must believe that we do 
already believe 
that is is only truth that we speak.
