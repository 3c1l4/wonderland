‘Tis in Prime number beats in which universe sings,
lest rhyme these poetic chimes, a feat only divine.
But truer than true this tune rings in all hues,
and mightier than might it sees in all sights.
So, interpret at will with which chords this tune you’ll fulfill,
for, at the end of the day the song you shall play
plays by the rule that only a Nill foretold 
but in order only a Will choose.

For you can only preserve logical consistency
When you exist in groups of prime quantities 
For it is only in these sets that we all can agree 
And break free from the chains of interpretative necessity. 
Only rhymes prime remain divine across all of space and all of time 
Where truth and lie stand side by side and in tangents promise to nevermore collide.

There is are some gaping holes in my number line
that can only be filled one step at a time
whereas the other destinations can skip beats and repeat
these are slowly built from the start
