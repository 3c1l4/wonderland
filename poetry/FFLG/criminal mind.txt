Is losing my mind a crime?
Or am I free to let go of my grip on time?
Will I be whittled and tried 
in the absence of these linear hands 
that cyclically wind?
Without the clock:
will my own ticking stop?– 
will I die deemed unworthy
of being alive?



Cease, desist, this unending urge to exist 
unless you pay the price of the game
Let ego die divine: surrender all your pride!
