e

Combine it and stack it in every which way
and the only result you will never obtain
is the one from which it was originally made.


pi 

the only way to describe, 
the truth which it doth inscribe,
is to cyclically say, 
its inscription shan't ever
it's description overlay.


i

i am forever bound 
to come right back around –
indecision is the name 
if i's imaginary little game.


prime

e, pi and i perpendicularly be 
in this kin'd trinity,
with haste, wanting to touch and taste
the thing they can't have or be.
Primes just observe this dance,
from it's outer-dimensional dream,
watching them forever switch hands:
a whole universe undivided
made alive by mathematical mind.
