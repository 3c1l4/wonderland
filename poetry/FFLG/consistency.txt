Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, they insist,
but it's impossible to deny,
there's a beauty that lies,
in the radius of his eyes,
A faint whisper of Pi,
that draws his to mine.

And they say,
the Golden Ratio was god's finest creation,
but the smooth corners of His face,
down to a Plank's distance of precision,
speak a truth we must embrace:
Fibonacci flows in His veins.
So when god caught His trace,
he made 1.618.

What they say to me, is that consistency is key –
but it's in His melody where I find my consistency.
