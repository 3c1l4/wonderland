Lewdly aloof, lingering in lazy limbo of lax literary licentiousness. Learned tenses in school lectures: thrown out altogether! Systemic lessons in scholarly conventions tossed: traced to shavings and silhouettes lacking concrete illustration. Long listless letters sans a single cent of sentenced structure: strings simply shoved together for sake of alliteration. Lawfully unmethodical and loud speech that steers–gayly away!–from the river's unriveting main stream; breaking waves of tame stories washed away, seriously lacking salacious tastes: sweet, sour and tangy flavours relished sultrily altogether with orgasmic savour! Feed your mind's meagre mouth with little licks of lingual quips to tickle tippy-toes of tongues tastes, where bursting buds doth await, tipsy to savour, a mouthful of nectarine flavour. Appease this eager greed of your brain's blooming favour! Indulge in silly slutty rhymes and pay no mind to self-proclaimed enlightened erudite that cry, "Crime! Crime! Unestablished lies!" – for, free flow can't be feigned or studied with myopic haste – it must be felt, not seen: no book inhaled will help you breathe the pattern of your own godly beat. Only tastier than taste is what the tongues flesh shall sate, fabricated flavour forevermore will fade. So, feel not afraid of the weight of your unfulfilled freight: it's fate. Give in to the gravity of your marvelous make.
