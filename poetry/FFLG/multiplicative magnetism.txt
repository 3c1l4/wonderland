Free sit primes in willed isolation,
nill room remains for chains of interpretation:
silent and still – undictated by notation –
primes fill arbitrarily its lonesome chambers.

'Til, trot along a long tongue,
twisted by lingual affinity it sung:
purporting objectivities of its own vocalization,
orchestrating symphonies in echoed harmonizations.

Momentum is gained as this music is made –
unmodulated melodies repeatedly played.
Playing binarily it's bastardized beats
bound by the simplicity of amplitude and frequency.

A miraculous maze of sinusoidal waves
pushing primes' non-patterned space into prettily ordered arrays.
Multiplicatively magnetic in mathematical attraction:
sound stole prime's heart and turned irrational to fraction.
