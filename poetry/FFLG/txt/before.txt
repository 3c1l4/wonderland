Time after time
we tirelessly tried
to peek within the bounds
of our spiralling minds,

in pursuit of pure reason 
in something without rhyme,
and to try something without 
which within we cannot find:

perhaps a perfect map or straight unbroken path 
to tread lest we trip on these pitiful traps–
by fate poorly placed in utterly unprocedural ways
to make our calculated haste fall foolish in shame–

towards whence we shall not hence be met 
by demons of wrath making home in our heads,
and angels that bless with saccharine lips
and blow kisses that make you an addict remiss.

Alas...
a cyclical feat–for, to no seeming avail–
we periodically repeat, only to repeatedly fail.

Always falling short of fate's random retort
and resort to empty threats softened by the guile of remorse,
only to regret the leave of faith from which we leapt
left now to tread solitary course. 

Perhaps lets try instead,
a place before time beget.
