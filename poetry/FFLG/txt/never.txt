	I would never

A claim you can't afford to stake, a false promise, a purported prophecy:
Pale in hues of truth and opaquely shaded by a vain saturate–
in pursuit of taking tomorrows blues, but blinded by a bright yesterday.

For, when the time has come and you've swallowed your tongue 
you will never again dare say
you would never again.
But now you see, you've made a new promise to me 
from which you will always never now be free.

I promise to stop making promises I can't keep
and I promise this will be the last, 
at least until I reach my next final defeat.
(for how could I possibly know 
which ones will have me beat?)
