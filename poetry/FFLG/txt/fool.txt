Inevitably I will fool myself just to be fooled by me. 
I just wish that I could with certainty tell 
whether I am the fool or the foolee. 
Perhaps then I could cast a spell 
and break myself utterly free 
from the infinite chains in this cyclical hell 
where I only serve to imprison me.

Damning your demons only damns you right back 
for you are deaf to the deity that blindly attacks.
You stab yourself back, 
even stronger in fact!– 
for you gained all the power 
from your own previous attack.
