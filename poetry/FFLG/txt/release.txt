Past and future together dance
to make common this present tense:
whence first has't next since passed
to posthumously arrive at previous last.
Current moment makes solo most sense,
free from the grips of interpretative trance,
of the pushes and pulls of vectored directions,
and the inertially-moved velocity and momentum.

Hence, feel present: release your tension;
just ease off the growing acceleration.
(it's really quite derivative 
when you come not to think of it).
