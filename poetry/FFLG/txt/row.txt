I don’t think 
I just row
toward the brink
on my boat. 

I go with the flow 
and feel myself float
toward the abyss 
I now call my home.

I feel the void shrink 
and shrink 
and shrink
until instinct kicks in 
and I sink.

Deep down I dive 
and revive
the turbulent ticking 
of treacherous time.

The clock starts to wind
and brings back to life
the cyclical mind
that kills the quiet of tides.

Oh my old boat, 
where the fuck did you go?
Where is my abyss? 
Why must life unfold?
Why must I think?
Where do I go?

I miss my little boat
I wish I did not know.
I was so happy just to row,
without this inner world.
