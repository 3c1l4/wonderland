Oh how there are plenty of sea in my fish 
and green in my wave,
cages that wish to be 
free from feathered chains,
purple petals in my bees,
honeycombs in the breeze,
yellow flowers in the trees
buzzing by busily.

But still, there seems to be nothing wrong
with the harmony in nature's song,
for, I have learned that beauty truthfully lies 
only inside the beholder’s wishful eyes.
