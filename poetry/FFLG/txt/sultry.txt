Lewdly aloof, lingering in lazy limbo of lax literary licentiousness. Learned tenses in school lectures: thrown out altogether! Systemic lessons in scholarly conventions tossed: traced to shavings and silhouettes lacking concrete illustration. Long listless letters sans a single cent of sentenced structure: strings simply shoved together for sake of alliteration. Lawfully unmethodical and loud speech that steers–gaily away!–from the river's unriveting main stream; breaking waves of tame stories washed away, seriously lacking salacious tastes: sweet, sour and tangy flavours relished sultrily altogether with orgasmic savour. Feed your mind's meagre mouth with little licks of tiny lingual quips. Trickle nectar taste down your tongue that hastes for sate, and tickle tippy toes of blooming buds that cannot bear to wait. Loosen rigid grips, unstrictly sip 'till you tipsily trip, slipping on the liquid flavour that you quickly tip and savour–get your greasy fill of this quirky flavour. Only tastier than taste shall sate lust for cake, fabricated flavour forevermore will fade. Appease the eager greed of your brain's fresh booming favour! Indulge in silly slutty rhymes and pay no mind to self-proclaimed enlightened erudite that cry, "Crime! Crime! Unestablished lies!"–for, free flow can't be feigned or studied with myopic haste–it must be felt, not seen: no book inhaled will help you breathe the pattern of your flesh's godly beat. So, feel not afraid of the weight of your unfulfilled freight: it's fate. Give in to the gravity of what your marvellous mind may make. Let quills quiver and shake under truth's burdensome weight, lest be afraid, of what time engrave. Open your mind, lose your brain, find back your way in the darkness you create.
