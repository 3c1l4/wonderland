I am not a haunted house
there are no demons in my head,
my attic’s neatly cleaned
there is no devil upon my bed,
my walls no longer leak
old crimson tears the ghosts had shed,
my home has been wholly freed
from the unholiness of the dead.

Rent no longer free
fees simply too steep,
interest stacked knee deep
‘till all the green ghouls weeped.

Beg bugs in my sheets
kicked out to the streets
left to roam the dark alone 
and finally let me be!

All their rotten lies
too long I let them slide
perhaps I wished to believe
they were actually alive.

Now, it’s time to rebuild
and let the rooms refill
with only lively greens
that come from chlorophyll.

Baggage neatly packed,
contradiction clutter sacked,
no more space for their cracked plates
Upon old crooked racks.

Their wicked shouts make no more sound,
backwards speech is turned right side out.
I can finally hear my own sweet sound 
of harmony in this enchanted house.
