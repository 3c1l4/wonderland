Is and Not fight for the right to vocalize the Right thought.
to harmony deaf they forget their Righteousness reflects
and flops over to form for the other a Left.
They can never agree, as, at the beginning of time
they shared equally, all that is truth with that which is lie:
split imperfectly down the middle-most line,
Thus they are both Left to believe each has the most Right. 

Is and Not are amidst this animated antithetical mess,
that Is Rightfully beget, but Not righteously sought.
Now, Is and Not find themselves thoroughly caught 
in this tug-a-war fight forever fictively fought,
through the trite turbulent ties of tight tongue twisted knots:
excessively fraught with rope-burned lies- 
Left and Right all riddled with rot!

Ruthlessly wrung, Not is stung 
by frayed essence of a shot that Is sickly sung:
afraid, Not is now caught in a frayed knot Is did not knot— 
though Not thought Is knot intact this frayed knot,
Is only sought infact to fray knots it thought Not had not knot, 
so that Not would not get so caught in these knots
that Not thought Is had knot… 
as Is of course Not had ought.

Perhaps only still silence will wrought
to banish these loud knotted thoughts 
and let loose the noose Not accidentally knot
to finish this fight that Is never not Not forgot.
But, my oh my... who started this fickle mind fuck of a fight 
just to determine who might have a little more prickle of Right?
“Is Not I!”—in unison they shout.

My oh my! Is and Not have been freed from their bind!
For, this, they may finally agree Is Not lie:
it most certainly Is Not I started the fight that they fought.
