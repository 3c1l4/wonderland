Are you proud of your work?
Is it in first, or third person they curse?–
these words that beg to be tied to a verse.
Does it hurt when you let them float free on the page?–
cursive etchings of feelings running rampage.
What's worse: writing hoards of words hoarsely heard, within reach;
or sketching truth in the hue that no room can contain, nor a leash?
Does the frame bound in vain the hole that it made?–
or is the whole within solely bound to escape?
Can hurt be conveyed and chained
lulled to relief by syllables softly lain,
by alliteration, slain and tamed!–
can this endless pain be described lest in vain?
Are you proud of your work?
Neigh–erase all this hate for the art you create
write words you adore and let freedom reign.
