Thus, there is no good place to begin,
so, without hesitation, you dive right in:
head first into the frigid pool,
or perhaps, you let your heart take rule.
But, independent of what you desire,
whether a head or heart start, you do require
to make a choice of where you will begin,
your journey to find where to dive in.

But, if you believe that you have found,
the place which promptly lays the ground
for all that has-been and that will-ever be,
then, dear, I fear you have mistakenly,
in-fact just brought about another end,
that restarts your journey once again.

Alas, it appears choice was arbitrary:
for, start and end were not really necessary;
to require two distinct procedures –
to exist! – is not a prerequisite feature.
Perhaps there is a lone third choice,
where both are simultaneously voiced. 
And thus with continuity created,
You see, with ease: start and end are overrated.
