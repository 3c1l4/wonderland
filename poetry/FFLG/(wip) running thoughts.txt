It started with a thought
You let it run quite a lot
Perhaps a bit too much 
To the point you lost control of your touch 

This little thought ran wild 
beyond the pavements tiled 
right into the abyss 
where it thought you had been hid

It ran in what it thought were lines
but did not know that the fabric of the void
did circularly wind 

You let it dance and in circles prance
Because its beautiful put you under a trance
