Your stupid new ideas are getting old.
Please shut up – just stick to the mold.
Methods, perfected, have already been made,
and paths, by great minds – already paved.
Just follow the directions, we guarantee,
that with ease, you indeed will see
the reason to trust when we say:
should you continue to go this way,
things will cease to be okay.
the world will end, and you will pay;
you will swear to rue the day
that you decided to go astray.
You motherfucker - give right of way,
you must stay in your fucking lane.
