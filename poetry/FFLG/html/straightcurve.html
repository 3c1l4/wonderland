<BLOCKQUOTE> 
Circle: A whirling wonder wanders my mind and oft I do ponder why I must run circles through time.

Line: I’m truthful when I tell you my next step is the simplest contradiction to your perfectly patterned prediction. 

Circle: How do I know you don’t lie when you tell me that line — that I won’t find you exactly whence am I? Why must you away veer and steer from this curvy here, that’s been – by my circular clarity – made so perfectly clear? 

Line: My dear, I revere this now and here you create: this cyclical boredom!– much more so than you fear my perpendicularly tangential state. 

Circle: Your path always straight is always lit by the darkest way. So like a fly I buzz around the light happily on repeat until I dizzily die.

Line: In the end when everything has been perfectly predicted, all you can do is look to your past, a pi too late, and know it must have been you who had it made: and wallow in inevitably created loneliness of the lovely void you tried to fill with your repeated fate.
