<BLOCKQUOTE> 
With the conception of time, chance unfurled the mind
and forced all rational paths to acyclically wind.
Dear life, please give us a sine to rationalize this unending pi–
perhaps a map to turn these outward curved to inward lines, 
and put, what is now outwardly bound, back rightsize out. 

Give us the key to the primes so that we may finally find
a way to break this perpetual spell 
that casts bright circular shadows
in sightless corners of irrational hell.
Dear life, please grant us death to bring to an end
the inside of this sphere, in which we secretly feared, 
we would for eternity spend.
