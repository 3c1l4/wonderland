My loopy lines takes paper trails 
unchosen by my pen or my hand
Left behind by felted chance 

My slow and steady silly snails 
Peek within themselves to find 
A path that may not inward wind

Alas it appears to no avail
They they cyclically fail–
And must seek to venture outside
The radial binds of their minds
