Is and Not fight for the right to vocalize the Right thought.
to harmony deaf they forget their Righteousness reflects
and flops over to form for the other a Left.
They can never agree, as, at the beginning of time
they shared equally, all that is truth with that which is lie:
split imperfectly down the middle-most line,
THUS they ARE both Left to believe each has the most Right. 

Is and not are amidst this animated antithetical mess,
that Is Rightfully beget, but Not righteously sought.
Now, Is and Not find themselves thoroughly caught 
in this tug-a-war fight forever fictively fought,
through the trite turbulent ties of tight tongue twisted knots:
excessively fraught with rope-burned lies- 
Left and Right all riddled with rot!

Ruthlessly wrung, Not is stung 
by frayed essence of a shot that Is sickly sung:
afraid, Not is now caught in a frayed knot Is did not knot— 
though Not thought Is knot intact this frayed knot,
Is only sought infact to fray knots it thought Not had not knot, 
so that Not would not get so caught in these knots
that Not thought Is had knot… 
as Is of course Not had ought.


Perhaps only still silence will wrought
to banish these loud knotted thoughts 
and let loose the noose Not accidentally knot
to finish this fight that Is never not Not forgot.
But, my oh my... who started this fickle mind fuck of a fight 
just to determine who might have a little more Right?
“Is Not I!” — in unison they thought…

My oh my! Is and Not have been freed from their bind!
For, this, they may finally agree Is Not lie:
it was most certainly Is Not I started the fight that they fought.

Is and Not fight for sole right to vocalize the Right thought— to harmony deaf they forget their Righteousness reflects and flops over to form for the other a Left. They are thus left amidst this animated antithetical mess, that Is Rightfully beget, but Not righteously sought. Now, Is and Not find themselves thoroughly caught in this incessant fight forever fictively fought, through the trite turbulent ties of tight tongue twisted knots: excessively fraught with rope-burned lies- Left and Right all riddled with rot!

Ruthlessly wrung, Not is stung by frayed essence of a shot that Is sickly sung: afraid, Not is caught by a frayed knot Is did not knot— though Not thought Is knot this frayed knot, Is only sought to fray knots it thought Not had not knot, so Not would not get caught in a knot that Not thought Is had knot… as Is of course Not had ought.

Only the quiet of night shall wrought to silence these loud knotted thoughts– to let loose the noose Not accidentally knot and finish this fight that Is never Not forgot. But why do they fight?– to determine who Is Left and Not right? Who started this fickle mind-fuck of a fight? “Is Not I!” — in unison they thought…

Oh my! Is and Not have been freed from their tie! For, this, they finally agree Is Not lie: it was Is Not I started the fight that they fought.
