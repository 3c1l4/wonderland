I was running so late, 
finally let loose out my cage,
towards the rat-riddled race 
I paid to participate.
I stomped down the street 
with such unforgiving speed 
that the ground shatters and shakes 
as it bears burden my weight,
and in utter defeat, 
its dull grey finally breaks free
and lawfully flees
from bounds of earth's cruel gravity.

it was right then and there
where from under the sole of my feet 
my soul seeped, 
and I fell–
from the logical grace 
of binarily-blocked ways,
right into the depths 
of an irrational hell.

where time winds 
in paths labyrinthine
through ways unpaved 
by predictable fates.
where lies tell truths 
with a beautiful smile
and crooked-toothed truths 
snarl with hate. 
where disorder is sorted 
in untamed arrays,
and order is foreign 
to the rules of the game.

And I fell. 

Oh well!

Good riddance I say!
For the floor had such a long face
and often stared back in a rude blocky way,
as though I had stepped on its cracks 
and crookened it's stacks!
But, alas, it was only a counter attack,
(for, first, it broke my good ol' mother's back).

So, I waved the thick ground a gruesome goodbye 
as I fell right across 
the highest point in the ceiling of hell.

And I fell.... and fell... and fell..
unfree from the fall, 
stuck in a free falling spell.

And I fell.... And fell... and fell...
when, suddenly, 
I could tell!

So imperfectly clear it finally appeared!
depth perception was an illusory conception.
For, though the ground grew and grew 
from farther in my view,
in lieu of any limit of approach–
it was utterly unbounded by infinite growth!

but then the room become consumed 
by the floor that had peripherally loomed 
surely... I must be on the brink of doom.

When suddenly,
it began to shrink! 
and...
PLINK!
It disappeared to a dot!
then...
CLUNK! 
I came to a full-fucking stop!

I dusted myself off and got up from the ground
I looked up and down and all around,
and only wonders in this strange land were what I found:

crooks that crotchet–with might!– 
and grannies that commit crime–with fright!–
in all the nooks and crannies 
of these lefts that point only right,
illuminated only by a black sun's jet-dark light 
that rises in the west at dawn's midnightly crest
and sets in the morning's eight AM dusk,
casting endless bright circular shadows 
in rigid corners of these nightmarish hollows.

And there he stood sans disguise soaked in blood,
head to toe weathered by a crimson stained flood.
He held out a stylus, feathered, and said:
	"my dear, its for you to write with,
	just try it, it's fair!"
I extended my hand and tested the pen
then he gave me a sheet and swore he was a friend.

I read between the lines and all the prints fine
in the four point font style 
the devil chose for the file,
my binary logic dichotomously processed
word for fucking word, 
and I thought the doc 
seemed perfectly prim and proper!

I gripped my pen steady and readily signed,
a transactional trade:
he gave me a prickle of pain 
for a fraction of time.
A deal to let him steal 
some of the pieces of me 
that were Real:

all the irrational tids stuck senseless 
between the sensible fractional bits
That seemed to serve no purpose 
but to wreak havoc on my neat ordered circuits
a paved way that should lead to path moving straight
not astray in confabulated spiralling ways.

Then I saw all the signs that cried through his eyes
screaming in bold, italicized and underlined:
a dark header that said there was something not very right
a trap left behind, invisible to the logic of light!
so, I grabbed my UV flash and through the sheet let it shine
and the paper promises crumbled and I felt utterly asinine!
he smiled with guile and danced a dance vile, 
he didn't even thank me as he pranced down the aisle
of the narrow corridors that stretched for miles and miles
and left me to stand alone for a while.

But the deal was done, 
the contract was filed,
I was left with no more than none
without jury or trial. 
What have I done?
Where do I go?
Where is the bright sun?
Please take me home.

The cold came close to boiling my bones 
I shivered and shook, I sat and I weeped, 
And suddenly...
I fell right back up to my feet!
And I floated upside down 
towards the ceiling that was now the ground
and in the background 
boomed a loud thundering sound
It announced:
	
	"welcome back to the past,
	it's only here where future shall last"


I must admit, I did not understand
I was too busy thinking of whence I shall land.


When suddenly, I found myself back on the street 
from which I had fallen and originally seeped, 
staring down at the radiant grey 
of the solid and sturdy dirty concrete.

With wonder I pondered the style of the etchings engraved
and was enthralled by the beautiful essence gracefully lain–
block by block–for miles, perfectly straight
in the nooks and crannies of very drive, circle and lane,
totally tamed by logical order that reigned.

I now saw what I did not previously see
clouded by rainy fears that had festered in me
and tears that fogged up these glorious streets. 
I was home free:

where fear is not fed by demons homed in my head 
where love can be honed and hate can be shed:
tossed in the abyss, 
left to reft in the rift,
signals utterly lost to the synapse of my cleft.

And I was free, I was always here:
I let go of the past, for it lingered too near,
I let the future ring and, as it's call I do hear,
I opened my heart and knew it could not be hurt
For the future told me it was never too late 
to start the journey to love once again.


At least for a while...
Until I remember what I'd seen and lose the grip on my smile.
Until then I shall live in a forgetful old dream
And sing.
