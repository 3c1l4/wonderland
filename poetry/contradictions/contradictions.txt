I tend to think I'm quite funny because
of these silly thoughts I think, and am thus,
compelled to conceptualize in a tense,
contradictory to forward flow of sense.
Alas, I have not yet succeeded, you see,
as there are some things that simply can't be!
As, were we to instead un-deceivingly find,
that we actually move backwards through time,
or perhaps sideways or in a strangely shaped curve,
we would find we indeed did preserve,
consistency in our new fucked up universe.
