Leave me alone 
please
But don’t go 
Get away from me 
I want you to stay 
But I fly solo
Oh anxiety 
Please 
Please 
Please 
Please
Oh anxiety
Don’t leave me alone 
Just go 
Won’t you stay with me 
I need you to come
And drive me home 
Please oh please 
anxiety 
Just Hold my hand 
Ease me with despair 
Won’t you be my friend 
Help me feel more scared
Don’t leave me hanging there 
by thin threads
Of unlasting happpiness 
That won’t compare 
To your eternal glare 
Please oh please
Anxiety 
Stay away with me 

Fuck you 
Make it stop
But don’t leave me 
I am lost
