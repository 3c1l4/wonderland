To Dislike is to wish it were not so
but I wish for all to be just as they go,
and so, I Dislike-not all things I know.

And so, Dislike is one I do not know.
I most Dislike the way it will go:
in paths and ways which I cannot know.

In fact, it is exactly what it is not! 
So, I know which way it will not go,
Ah... so, I know exactly where it is to show!

Thus, I must then wish it were indeed, so:
I do not Dislike it, as I now know,
Dislike – into Love it will grow.

To Dislike is not to wish it were not so.
Oh, no...
