I am Present in a rather tense circumstance:
prior to when truth will posthumously permanence 
and after potential was yet to beget,
it is then when I witness the paths Past tirelessly tread.

Forward facing, almost as if with intent, he trotted along
towards when history and fiction fleetingly met,
to create a story by no one written or read,
only heard by unspoken words in a transient verse. 

Here, Past and Future met in an encounter so curt,
right up to the point where they agreed to reverse. 
For, Past had learned not hinge his hopes on something unknown 
but future, so bright, saw only the potential in light! 
She wanted to share a glimpse of her stare
and steal a bit of his fear that halted him there.

Hand in hand they danced the dance of their backwards advance,
until Past was free of all he had known to be
towards a time that would wind in acyclical lines,
and she found peace in the darkness when he could not see.
