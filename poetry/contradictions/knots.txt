I’ve exhausted all rational whys and why-nots in my mind– 
all the binary ways lead forever straight
to concreted fates, to paths all perfectly paved
by bricks black and white, and walls built perfectly unscathed,
begging with might to be untimely replaced–

by stones and sticks shaped by nature's unrefined tastes;
by beautiful chaotic Fibonnaci-like shapes:
upon itself spiralled, fabricated by pure entropy wild!–
an authentic aggregate of unbinary ways,
inspired not by dichotomous arrays;
towards which our bricked storeys may forever feign, 
but only ever infinitesimally approximate.

My big city limits’ burning destiny awaits
to ashen these stupid skyscrapers to waste:
so, I try to repaint pebbles in shades of grey
but my hand is not light and my lines are not fine:
sticky fat fingers intertwine from tied knots my mind–
for, there – though, try as I mechanically might–
these silly whys and why-nots are all I ever find.
Stuck with no greyscale in the black and white cities undivine.
