maybe it’s time to stop sulking in the sunshine
and learn to bask in the rain enjoy the music
the silent pitter patter that loudly scatters in random arrays 
of unpredictable but beautiful patterns, much less tame, 
but just as certain, as the day’s dulling rays.
are you scared of hearing a different tune hidden in this blue hue?of being whittled and worn by the fickle weathering storm?
you wish the past was more distant, but show only resistance
to a soft spoken future that promises only burdens light—but not blindingly bright—as a free feathery night.don't you know?you’re not a sick ghost.
just homed by a dead host
that hones quite a lovely soul
