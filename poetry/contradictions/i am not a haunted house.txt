I am not a haunted house
there are no demons in my head,
my attic’s neatly cleaned
there is no devil upon my bed,
my walls no longer leak
old crimson tears the ghosts had shed,
my home has been wholly freed
from the unholiness of the dead.

The rent was no longer free
and the fee was simply too steep,
interest stacked knee deep
‘till all these green ghouls weeped,
beg bugs in my sheets
kicked out to the streets
left to roam the dark alone 
and finally let me be!

All their rotten lies
too long I let them slide
perhaps I wished to believe
they were actually alive.

Now, it’s time to rebuild
and let the rooms refill
with only lively greens
that come from chlorophyll.

Baggage neatly packed,
contradiction clutter sacked,
no more space for cracked plates
Upon old crooked racks.
