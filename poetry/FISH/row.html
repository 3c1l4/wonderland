I don’t think 
I just row
toward the brink
on my old boat. 

I go with the flow 
and feel myself float
toward the abyss 
I now call my home.

I feel the void shrink and shrink and shrink
until my instinct kicks in and I sink
and seep down I dive, and am made to revive 
the ticking of time.
The clock cyclically winds, 
and my mind’s made fully alive
now the quiet of the tide turbulently dies.

Thundering brightness fills my void with it's lightness 
So dense and intense I didn't stand a fucking chance.
Oh my low little highness where did you go?
Now, only vice lives as this universe unfolds.

Reflections of vanity's endless gluttony
which sees it's greed as a beautiful deed–
indeed–this ego has me surrender in utter defeat
for it is it's curious quirks I now aim to please. 

I miss my little boat
I wish I did not know. 
I was so happy not awake.
But I do love this little world
whence my thinking doth be made. 
So I suppose I must go, 
And forward forevermore row.
