From deep within slumbering dreams of dozen–awake!
Your first meal awaits: soft served, or warmly baked.
Break your fast from divinely slow rest 
with that angelic cake that you so deeply crave.
Eat away! Fear the fleeting taste, 
lick your lips clean from this devilish kiss 
'Till you can double your dip–
lest no haste, make quickly fourth second plates.

Lunch comes on cue, not a second too late, 
beige coloured hues inundate your plate: 
all colours of the skin coloured rainbow, 
eat up!– diversity: it's good for you.
Do not fret crunchy green, they reset your palette clean, 
so guilt-free you may indulge more soft frozen treats.

A fruit salad sublime–no, no... scratch that, 
underneath that lime–yes, right there: 
*sub*-lime is where you will find 
a fat juicy steak, but make no mistake, 
this beast was most unkindly slain 
just to add to your unending reserves of weight. 

Dine dine die!–you fat greedy swine. 
Save no space, for morrow await 
stomach ache from today's over-sate.
So with your three squared meals complete, 
you may now in a sweet coma sleep
and dream sticky donut dreams.
