Don't tell me I taste like honey
then preach your tooth's not sweet,
lick your lips clean of this flavour
then claim you don't eat treats,
too nectarine to savour
the saccharine of my kiss,
then on your diet cheat
for this bliss you can't resist.

Don't treat me like a guilty pleasure
I can tell you feel ashamed,
you don't need to leave me now or never
you can always change your fate.
Know I am not an endeavour
nor a feat to feel at ease,
a treat to distract you from
the shit you can't defeat.

But that doesn't mean I cannot bring
the comfort that you need,
a boost of sugar that fills to the brim
your youthful energy.

Please don't beat yourself up 
when you indulge in me,
show yourself some sweet love
don't stand in defeat.
