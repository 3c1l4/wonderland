Your weight is not a burden,
no, it is a golden treasure–
because we're all just taking turns
being anchors for each other.
For, when the time is mine
to be light like the feather,
you will save me from the breeze
blown blue by fickle weather,
and bring me back to breathless ease
with the heaviness you endeavour.

Your shape is not too twisted,
no, it is a tense and tied up knot–
topologically encrypted,
trite in fear of being torn apart. 
But, when the time is rightly mine
to weave my way between your thoughts,
I will try to map your mind
so you are never lost,
and fight to help unwind the might
with which ties wreak chaos.
