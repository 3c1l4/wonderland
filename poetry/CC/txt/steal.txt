Steal my art,
please don't let it die in vain
for this is the highest respect you can pay in my name.

Call it your own,
let it grow old with seeds I have sown 
and blossom to petals with hues of your tone.

Tear it apart,
please pick through these veins 
for it paves all the paths that my essence takes.

Make it your home,
and, with the flow of my blood, let it glow
flood freely the air with the breath of your blow.
