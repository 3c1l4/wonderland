I don't want to be Eve, 
but as dusk sets to a morrow
my Adam is waiting, 
sinking in solemn sorrow,
asking me which flowers I love to see most,
which sounds and smells I wish to hear and breathe,
only wanting to know
whence next I am to show.

He asks me how I feel,
to describe what I know is real:
he points with force to songs of birds 
upon the willow trees,
and the silly little buzzing words 
of busy honey bees,
the billowing woodland critters
crying out what they see,
waiting for my choice to be chose 
so his gaze may follow where I will be.

How can I choose which pretty flower to pick
when 'tis foretold whose poison it shall prick?

Oh forsake. Bustling gardens sicken me,
beauty, growing on every branch of every tree,
for every shade of green there's a leaf,
and every tone of pink there's a petal scented sweet. 
It seems to me all this beautiful glory
Is just a sorry metaphor 
a cover for another horny story.
