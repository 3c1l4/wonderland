He was like a fungi
and lichened me to a tree–
unpredictable yet stable–
and so he said he'd never leaf,
and on my trunks he grew,
so that in a symbiosis we mossed always be,
when winds blew and my branches flew
I knew, he was meant for me.

With his touch my petals blushed
In shades of red I'd never dreamed.
And with his gush my mushroom flushed
with spores before I hadn't seen.
And with this love the critters rushed
To, in our forest, run so free.
