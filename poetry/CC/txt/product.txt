Good morning!
caffeine mugs deep
brushed teeth
flossed grin
toiletries
stacked neat
stocked cyclically
lest deplete
shampoo'd
foamy dew
lather, scrub,
rinse, repeat.
unleathered skin
sanded sheen
plastic clear
wholly clean
of unholy primal sin.
hair conditioned
to a fine thick silk
tightly wound inside the spiral
of a microfibre textured towel.
insulate moisture dry
use talcum powder to unchafe your thighs
wear your clothes to keep the cold at bay
and compensate for innate layers
unnaturally shaved away.
daily routine brought to an end 
sealed and sedated
magnesium, benadryl, and melatonin.
be extremely ordinary,
buy in bulk your stationary,
don't move: stay here and busily keep it nice and clean.
remain organized: be beautiful and binary, 
never forget, your natural flow is the adversary.

Wake up!
innervate adrenal state!
brown coffee
breath of death
black cavities
rotting flesh
gargle, slosh,
spit, repeat,
spit into the sink
that neon green
stained by bloody
crimson tint
of gums painfully 
scraped brightly clean
artificially bleach veneers
in the curing corners of the devil's grin
only half insured by public dentistry
paid in full with your pain and fear.
chemical stenches near
stripping your scalp
of natural lube,
re-oiled with poison from a tube
tested on the innocent
whose sebum sold
at the price of solid gold.

aspartame, sucralose, oligosaccharides to replace glucose;
ibuprofen, acetaminophen, opioids to replace endorphins;
whence do you hide?–
from the beautiful pain 
of being alive?
but, go ahead, pop those pills, 
numb your senses: 
warning signs made to ease 
consumption–left unchecked: 
absolute and utterly endless.

You buy these things 
to make them filthy rich
you sell your health 
to get paid more sick;
you trade your skin for reserves of cash
that itch and scratch a phantom rash
bought to believe by a stream of ads!

Product is what tarnishes thee, 
the real solution is always free
your eyes can see your lungs can breath: 
utterly mindlessly! 
Can't you see? redundancy 
is (by definition) 
unnecessary.

Maybe if you’re sold enough problems
you’ll buy enough solutions, 
which really just displace old disease 
with anew set of sickly symptom.
