Slowly but surely, in a silent saunter,
in heavy boots though snowy streets, I limp and wander,
painting pavements pink, in pursuit of displacing blues
tainted by missing ink from my pretty pink running shoes.
Oh, speed!– what a dreaded thing to lose,
unpaced by heavy weight dawned by big navy boots.

Alas, their innocent tones do not know not
of grounds they cannot tread, and of places they cannot go.
Their steps cannot sing beats flashy and pink,
but their sturdy song steadily drowns unharmonious ink.

So, though snow seeps deep and cold into my soul,
with a blue blaze upon my feet– forward I go,
and for a little while, I learn to frown a purple smile
sauntering slow through lavender streets alone.
