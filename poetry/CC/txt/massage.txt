Your gentle grip, glossed by a frictionless glaze
mindfully meanders my muscular maze.
My green gardens you graze–and trim vine by vine;
With those thumbs of thine that thread fine–line by line
through these labyrinthine veins of mine.

Oh my goodness grace!
Light as a feather, oh, limbs, they've grown so heavy!–
lulled to a laze, sewn tightly together
by the blooming dance from your lace;
dazed by the trance from my silhouette that you trace.

Behold!–I have been saved!
By the massage artist that paints pain away.
