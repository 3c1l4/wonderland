Indulge in vain or let it waste
subpar is taste of abundant cake.
Tongues deep in trance of decadent dance
where savoury meets saccharine to sate. 

Lingering trace of sickly sweet taste
lazily motivate the glutton’s chase.
Ambrosial fires of dreamt desire
confound an ache for a starved state. 

But long abidden fruit un-ate
unrelished rapidly with rot will replace
day by day as green tint fade
overripe displaces and mellow sweet fades. 

Allow guileless greed to await
pinky promises of perfect taste-
on yellow feast hasty flies will feed-
away! - with which waft and wave you stave

So have your fruit but not your cake
or feet deep you'll find your early grave
side by side hungry parasites,
twice thus enticed by your lifeless eyes.

To win this fight between vanity and delight
thou must learn to waltz with them right
step by step do not over correct,
dance the dance with slow advance. 

So indulge away, just not in vain:
present a productive product of your pain-
For, delicate is the intricate balance,
Between the mighty feast and beastly famine.
