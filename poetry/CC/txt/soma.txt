Is there a fissure in your tissue 
causing you a little issue? 
Do your muscles twitch and fuss
and make your system all nervous?

Maybe if you correctly trace
all the paths your veins can take,
you can find where pain resides
and use your mind to make it fade.

I can dish you an inch of glue
to help hold your stitch so it won’t undo,
but it is true that only you 
are your own rival
in this somatic stifle.
