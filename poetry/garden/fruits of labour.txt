Savour, mindfully, the fruits of mine labour
For it is indeed for thine I do bleed.
Their flavour, mind not it too deep,
for, a true field to acquire a good yield
must be straightened by a sum of bad equally.
So, fear not contingencies of potential displease, 
let it save thee from from gluttonous greed
so you may forevermore sew the love from my seeds.
