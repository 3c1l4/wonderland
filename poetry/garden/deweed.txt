Pray tell, does this balance seem right?—
their hell: caused by your over-delight;
does this not ignite deepest fright?— 
mares wake you and cause malaise past midnight?— 
sweet sick you and disease your stomach to ache? 

Does sick twiddled to stick suffit?— 
to feed your branches full and thick, 
of luscious leaves!—and, brightly greens!— 
that are gently brushed by a brazen breeze, 
and harshly leaves them to a lone cold freeze, 
so that warmth buds your blooms with breathless ease: 
purple petals to drown panicked pleas. 
Unbalanced trees: a bonsai diseased,
Pray tell, does this balance seem right?

Is this pretty enough to numb the ick?— 
scarred by scabs relentlessly picked:
prodded by you, their skin exposed a crimson 
to neutralize this blue frozen tincture: 
untrue to life’s hot rosy hue, 
that’s hidden far from their reach 
behind fatly flushed cheeks that reek 
of too many stored summer seeds— 
selfishly stuffed to a rot then shamelessly spit and forgot!— 
for a famished winter they shall never seize.

Cease!— this endless consumption of grease 
that grows your gross with guileless greed.
Instead, spread sunny ease and feel winter deep. 
For once, tend to your garden: 
plant your own pits and sew your own seeds; 
slave yourself away for the fruits and flowers you truly crave, 
and abundantly clear you shall see:
that more time is freed to fill life with glee, 
when the fewest peaches and posies you need to deweed.
