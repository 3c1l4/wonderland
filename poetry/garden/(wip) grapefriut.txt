Grapefruit, who are you? 
Art thou the soma defined by cells aligned side by side, 
that swell divine, plump in their pulpous pink prime?
Pomplemousse, qui est tu? 
Est tu la dance entre le sol et les sementes
sewn, line by line, that grow intertwined 
Inside sublime slices of thine?
Sunken deep in your skin’s harbour
thou art the art that I soldemn savour
citric tang that tangos with taste, 
buds to bloom by golden flavour 
of sweet turned bitter red fruit. 
Maintenent, stay true — beautifully you — mon petite pomplemousse. 

Sweet subdued by your bitter tune
Your orange skin hides a pink within
Solely a citric critic dare claim thou is’t not divine — 
soured by the sublime yellow of lemons;
emotions mixed by the mellow of melons; 
Spare no slice of mind to these critics unkind —
embittered by an unnaturally sweet fruit salad feast for the heavens;
dreams infused by nectarines — dreading peaches, 
claiming they lack in sweetness — 
Only relative to the honey dew that tickles their tongues 
And tricks it to thinking the job has been done.



Deceived by your orange skin 
The bitter pink hue within 
Claimed: to poison 'tis must be due 
These reflections untrue to your outer tune 

But had they known not the orange before you,
My beautiful grapefruit.
They’d feel not deceived, by your relative hue.
