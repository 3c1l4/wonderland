Ease off fungi! 
You’re not that fun of a guy
when too hard you try.
You are simply trying too mush!
Trying too hard to gush in my mush room
Be patient, let linger this hush!
For, tacit stare scream glares 
of our infinitely quiet lust,
occasionally we may wink 
to reveal what we maybe think.
but words we shan't exchange 
or they shall let us fool ourselves again.
