I don't want to be Eve, 
but as dusk sets to a morrow
my Adam is waiting, 
sinking in solemn sorrow,
asking me which flowers I love to see most,
which sounds and smells I wish to hear and breathe,
only wanting to know 
where it may be next I shall go.

He asks me how I feel,
to describe what I know to be real:
he points to songs of birds upon the trees,
and the silly little buzz of busy bees.
Waiting for my choice to be chose 
so his gaze may follow where I will go.

How can I choose which pretty flower to pick
when 'tis foretold whose poison it shall prick?

His bustling garden sickens me,
beauty, growing on every branch of every tree,
for every shade of green there's a leaf,
and every tone of pink there's a petal.

It seems to me all this beauty
Is just a sorry metaphor 
for another horny story.

How can I choose which pretty flower to pick
when 'tis foretold whose poison it shall prick?
